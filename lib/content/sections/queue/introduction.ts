  title: 'Introduction to Queues',
  content: `A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** principle. Think of it like a line at a store - the first person in line is the first to be served.

**Why Queues Matter:**
- **Natural Model:** Represents real-world waiting scenarios
- **BFS Algorithm:** Essential for breadth-first search in trees and graphs
- **Task Scheduling:** Used in operating systems, printers, and job schedulers
- **Data Processing:** Buffering, streaming, message queues

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Operating Systems:** Process scheduling, task queues
- **Web Servers:** Request handling queues
- **Printers:** Print job queues
- **Customer Service:** Call center queues
- **Gaming:** Event queues, multiplayer matchmaking
- **Networking:** Packet queues in routers

**Key Insight:**
While Stack is Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), Queue is First-In-First-Out (FIFO). This makes queues perfect for scenarios where order of arrival matters and fairness is important.`,
