  title: 'Introduction to Math & Geometry',
  content: `**Math and Geometry** problems test your ability to recognize patterns, apply mathematical principles, and think creatively about spatial relationships.

**Why Learn Math & Geometry?**
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify mathematical relationships
- **Optimization**: Find efficient solutions using math properties
- **Real-world applications**: Used in graphics, games, simulations
- **Interview staples**: Common in coding interviews
- **Foundation**: Builds problem-solving intuition

**Common Problem Types:**
- Number theory (primes, divisors, GCD/LCM)
- Matrix manipulation (rotation, spiral, search)
- Coordinate geometry (distances, areas)
- Combinatorics (permutations, combinations)
- Mathematical sequences (Fibonacci, factorials)
- Modular arithmetic
- Angle and shape calculations`,
