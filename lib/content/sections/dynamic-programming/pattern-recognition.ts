## üö® Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Unclear State Definition
**Problem:** Not being precise about what dp[i] represents.

\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå BAD: Vague state
# "dp[i] = something about the first i elements"

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Precise state
# "dp[i] = maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in nums[0..i]"
# "dp[i][j] = minimum edit distance between s1[0..i] and s2[0..j]"
\`\`\`

**Why it matters:** Clear state definition drives correct recurrence relation.

### Mistake 2: Wrong Base Cases
**Problem:** Not handling empty inputs or edge cases.

\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå BAD: Missing base case
def coinChange (coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    # Forgot dp[0] = 0!
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i >= coin:
                dp[i] = min (dp[i], dp[i-coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount]

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Proper base case
def coinChange (coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: 0 coins needed for amount 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i >= coin:
                dp[i] = min (dp[i], dp[i-coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
\`\`\`

### Mistake 3: Wrong Iteration Order
**Problem:** Computing dp[i] before its dependencies are ready.

\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå BAD: Wrong order for LCS
def longestCommonSubsequence (text1, text2):
    m, n = len (text1), len (text2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range (m + 1)]
    
    # WRONG: Going backwards when we need forward
    for i in range (m, 0, -1):  # ‚ùå
        for j in range (n, 0, -1):  # ‚ùå
            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1  # Depends on smaller indices!
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max (dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    return dp[m][n]

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Forward iteration
def longestCommonSubsequence (text1, text2):
    m, n = len (text1), len (text2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range (m + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):  # ‚úÖ
        for j in range(1, n + 1):  # ‚úÖ
            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max (dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    return dp[m][n]
\`\`\`

### Mistake 4: Not Optimizing Space
**Problem:** Using 2D array when 1D would suffice.

\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå UNOPTIMIZED: O(n) space when O(1) possible
def rob (nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    n = len (nums)
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    if n > 1:
        dp[1] = max (nums[0], nums[1])
    for i in range(2, n):
        dp[i] = max (dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
    return dp[n-1]

# ‚úÖ OPTIMIZED: O(1) space
def rob (nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    prev2, prev1 = 0, 0
    for num in nums:
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, max (prev1, prev2 + num)
    return prev1
\`\`\`

### Mistake 5: Using DP When Greedy Works
**Problem:** Over-complicating with DP when greedy is sufficient.

\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå OVERKILL: Using DP for jump game when greedy works
def canJump (nums):
    n = len (nums)
    dp = [False] * n
    dp[0] = True
    for i in range (n):
        if dp[i]:
            for j in range(1, nums[i] + 1):
                if i + j < n:
                    dp[i + j] = True
    return dp[n-1]

# ‚úÖ BETTER: Greedy approach - O(n) time, O(1) space
def canJump (nums):
    max_reach = 0
    for i in range (len (nums)):
        if i > max_reach:
            return False
        max_reach = max (max_reach, i + nums[i])
    return True
\`\`\`

## üí° Interview Tips for DP Problems

### Tip 1: Start with Brute Force Recursion
\`\`\`
‚úÖ Good Approach:
1. Write naive recursive solution
2. Identify overlapping subproblems
3. Add memoization (top-down DP)
4. Convert to bottom-up if asked
5. Optimize space if possible

"Let me start with recursion to understand the problem structure,
then optimize with memoization..."
\`\`\`

### Tip 2: Draw the DP Table
\`\`\`
‚úÖ Communication Strategy:
"Let me visualize the dp table for a small example..."

Example: LCS of "abc" and "def"
    ""  d  e  f
""   0  0  0  0
a    0  0  0  0
b    0  0  0  0
c    0  0  0  0

Walk through filling the table: "If characters match, we take diagonal + 1..."
\`\`\`

### Tip 3: Explain State Transitions
\`\`\`
‚úÖ Clear Explanation:
"At each position, I have two choices:
1. Include current element ‚Üí dp[i-1] + nums[i]
2. Exclude current element ‚Üí dp[i-1]
I take the maximum of these two choices."
\`\`\`

### Tip 4: Recognize the Pattern Early
\`\`\`
Common question ‚Üí Pattern mapping:

"Climbing stairs" ‚Üí Fibonacci pattern
"Maximum subarray" ‚Üí Kadane\'s algorithm (1D DP)
"Longest increasing subsequence" ‚Üí LIS pattern
"Can partition to equal sum" ‚Üí 0/1 Knapsack
"Minimum cost path" ‚Üí Grid DP
"Transform string A to B" ‚Üí Edit Distance
"Find all ways to..." ‚Üí Counting DP
\`\`\`

### Tip 5: Discuss Time-Space Tradeoffs
\`\`\`
‚úÖ Show Optimization Thinking:
"My initial solution is O(n¬≤) time and O(n¬≤) space.
I can optimize space to O(n) by keeping only the previous row,
since we only need the previous row to compute the current row.
For some problems, we can even achieve O(1) space by keeping
just the last two values."

## üéì Problem-Solving Framework for DP

### Step 1: Identify It's a DP Problem
**Keywords to watch for:**
- Maximum/Minimum
- Longest/Shortest
- Count number of ways
- Is it possible
- Optimal strategy

**Validation:**
- Can break into subproblems?
- Do subproblems overlap?
- Can I optimize from brute force?

### Step 2: Define the State
**Ask yourself:**
- What varies in the problem?
- What do I need to know to make a decision?
- How many dimensions needed?

**Examples:**
\`\`\`
Fibonacci: dp[i] = fibonacci (i)
House Robber: dp[i] = max money robbing houses[0..i]
Knapsack: dp[i][w] = max value with first i items, capacity w
LCS: dp[i][j] = LCS length of s1[0..i] and s2[0..j]
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Find the Recurrence Relation
**Think about:**
- What decision am I making at each step?
- How do smaller subproblems combine?

**Common patterns:**
\`\`\`
Take/Skip: max (skip_it, take_it + prev)
Min/Max: min/max over all choices
Count ways: sum of ways from previous states
Path problems: sum of ways to reach current from previous cells
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Determine Base Cases
**Consider:**
- Empty input: dp[0] = ?
- Smallest valid input: dp[1] = ?
- Edge cases: boundaries, negatives, zero

### Step 5: Decide Iteration Order
**Rules:**
- Compute dependencies before dependents
- 1D: Usually left to right
- 2D: Usually top-left to bottom-right
- Sometimes reverse order (check recurrence!)

### Step 6: Implement and Optimize
**Progression:**
1. Recursive with memoization (top-down)
2. Iterative with table (bottom-up)
3. Space optimization (rolling array, variables)

## üîç When NOT to Use DP

### ‚ùå Don't use DP if:

**1. Greedy Works Better**
\`\`\`python
# Coin change with greedy coins (powers of 2: 1,2,4,8,16...)
# Greedy gives optimal solution
# DP would be overkill
\`\`\`

**2. No Overlapping Subproblems**
\`\`\`python
# Merge sort - divide and conquer, but subproblems don't overlap
# DP adds no benefit
\`\`\`

**3. Simple Math Formula Exists**
\`\`\`python
# Sum of 1 to n ‚Üí use formula n*(n+1)/2
# Don't need DP when closed-form solution exists
\`\`\`

**4. Linear Scan Suffices**
\`\`\`python
# Find maximum element ‚Üí just iterate
# DP would be unnecessary complexity
\`\`\`

**5. Problem Requires Backtracking**
\`\`\`python
# Generate all permutations ‚Üí need backtracking
# DP can't enumerate solutions, only count/optimize
\`\`\`
