  title: 'Object-Oriented Programming in Python',
  content: `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects that contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

**Why OOP Matters:**
- **Encapsulation:** Bundle data and methods that operate on that data
- **Inheritance:** Reuse code through parent-child class relationships
- **Polymorphism:** Use objects of different types through a common interface
- **Abstraction:** Hide complex implementation details

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Game Development:** Player, Enemy, Weapon classes
- **Web Frameworks:** Django models, Flask views
- **Data Processing:** Custom data structures and transformations
- **API Clients:** Service classes with methods for different endpoints

**Key Insight:**
OOP helps organize complex systems by modeling real-world entities and their relationships, making code more maintainable and easier to reason about.`,
