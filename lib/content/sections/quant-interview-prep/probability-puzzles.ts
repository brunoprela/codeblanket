# Probability Puzzles & Brain Teasers

## Introduction

Probability puzzles are the cornerstone of quantitative interviews at elite trading firms (Jane Street, Citadel, Two Sigma, Optiver, Jump Trading, SIG, DRW, IMC), hedge funds (Renaissance Technologies, DE Shaw, AQR), and quantitative research roles. These problems are deliberately designed to test your ability to think clearly under pressure, break down complex scenarios, apply probability theory creatively, and communicate your reasoning effectively.

**Why interviewers love probability puzzles:**

- **Structured thinking**: Can you decompose a complex problem into tractable components?
- **Intuition vs rigor**: Do you recognize when intuition fails and rigorous mathematics is needed?
- **Communication skills**: Can you explain your reasoning clearly to non-experts?
- **Creativity**: Can you find multiple solution approaches?
- **Hard to game**: Unlike memorizable coding patterns, probability puzzles require deep understanding
- **Real-world relevance**: Many puzzles mirror actual trading and risk management scenarios
- **Stress test**: How do you perform when you don't immediately see the solution?

This comprehensive section covers **150+ classic and advanced probability problems** organized by category and difficulty, each with:

- **Progressive hints** to guide you without revealing the answer
- **Multiple solution approaches** (intuitive, combinatorial, simulation, rigorous proof)
- **Python implementations** with detailed comments
- **Common mistakes** and why they're wrong
- **Interview tips** for communication and problem-solving strategies
- **Variations** and follow-up questions interviewers commonly ask
- **Time complexity analysis** for simulation approaches
- **Connections to trading** and real-world applications

## Interview Strategy & Framework

### The Six-Step Problem-Solving Approach

**1. CLARIFY (30 seconds - 1 minute)**
- Restate the problem in your own words
- Identify and resolve ambiguities
- Ask clarifying questions
- Define all terms and variables
- Confirm your understanding with the interviewer

**Example dialogue:**
> "Just to make sure I understand: we have three doors, one with a car and two with goats. I choose a door, then the host—who knows what's behind each door—opens a different door showing a goat. The question is whether I should switch. Is that correct?"

**2. STRUCTURE (1-2 minutes)**
- Draw diagrams or decision trees
- Enumerate possible outcomes
- Identify symmetries and patterns
- Determine sample space and events
- Consider edge cases

**3. ESTIMATE (30 seconds)**
- Make a quick intuitive guess
- State your confidence level
- This helps calibrate your final answer

**4. SOLVE (3-7 minutes)**
- Start with simple cases (n=1, n=2, n=3)
- Look for patterns
- Use multiple methods if possible
- Show all intermediate steps
- Apply relevant theorems (Bayes, law of total probability, etc.)

**5. VERIFY (1-2 minutes)**
- Sanity check: Is the answer between 0 and 1?
- Check edge cases
- Compare with intuitive estimate
- Verify with simple examples
- Consider simulation if time permits

**6. COMMUNICATE (throughout)**
- Think out loud
- Explain your reasoning
- Connect to intuition
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Be open to hints and redirection

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Mathematical Errors:**
- Confusing P(A|B) with P(B|A) (prosecutor's fallacy)
- Assuming independence when events are dependent
- Forgetting to condition on given information
- Double-counting outcomes
- Using wrong sample space

**Strategic Mistakes:**
- Rushing to calculate without understanding
- Getting lost in calculation details
- Ignoring interviewer's hints
- Refusing to pivot when stuck
- Not checking your final answer

**Communication Issues:**
- Working silently without explanation
- Using jargon without defining terms
- Not stating assumptions explicitly
- Failing to connect math to intuition

## Category 1: Classic Probability Puzzles

### Problem 1: The Monty Hall Problem (Easy)

**Setup:** You're on a game show with 3 doors. Behind one is a car, behind the other two are goats. You choose door 1. The host (Monty Hall), who knows what's behind each door, opens door 3 to reveal a goat. He then asks: "Would you like to switch to door 2?"

**Question:** Should you switch? What's the probability you win the car if you switch?

---

**PAUSE AND THINK**

Most people's initial instinct: "It doesn't matter, it's 50-50 now."

**This is wrong!** Here's why:

---

**Clarifying questions to ask:**
- Does the host always open a door with a goat? **Yes**
- Does the host always offer the switch? **Yes**
- Does the host know where the car is? **Yes**
- If I initially chose the car, which door does the host open? **Either of the remaining two, at random**

**Intuitive Explanation:**

When you initially choose door 1, you have a 1/3 chance of being right and a 2/3 chance of being wrong.

The key insight: **The host's action gives you information, but it doesn't change your initial probability of being correct.**

- P(you initially chose correctly) = 1/3 → stay wins
- P(you initially chose incorrectly) = 2/3 → switch wins

**Why switching is better:** If you initially chose wrong (2/3 probability), the host is forced to reveal the OTHER wrong door, meaning the remaining door MUST have the car. If you initially chose right (1/3 probability), switching loses.

**Rigorous Solution - Method 1 (Enumeration):**

Let's list all possible scenarios:

\`\`\`
Scenario | Car Location | You Choose | Host Opens | Switch Result
---------|--------------|------------|------------|---------------
   1     |    Door 1    |   Door 1   | Door 2 or 3|     Lose
   2     |    Door 2    |   Door 1   |   Door 3   |     Win
   3     |    Door 3    |   Door 1   |   Door 2   |     Win
\`\`\`

Each scenario has probability 1/3.

- P(win | stay) = 1/3 (only scenario 1)
- P(win | switch) = 2/3 (scenarios 2 and 3)

**Rigorous Solution - Method 2 (Bayes' Theorem):**

Let C_i = "car behind door i", H_j = "host opens door j"

We chose door 1, host opened door 3. What's P(C₂ | H₃)?

\`\`\`
P(C₂ | H₃) = P(H₃ | C₂) × P(C₂) / P(H₃)

P(H₃ | C₂) = 1      (host must open door 3 if car is behind 2)
P(C₂) = 1/3         (initial probability)

P(H₃) = P(H₃ | C₁) × P(C₁) + P(H₃ | C₂) × P(C₂) + P(H₃ | C₃) × P(C₃)
      = (1/2) × (1/3) + 1 × (1/3) + 0 × (1/3)
      = 1/6 + 1/3
      = 1/2

Therefore:
P(C₂ | H₃) = 1 × (1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3
\`\`\`

**Always switch!**

**Common Variations (Important!):**

**Variation 1: 100 Doors**
- You choose 1 door
- Host opens 98 other doors with goats
- Should you switch?
- **Answer: Yes! P(win | switch) = 99/100**

**Variation 2: Monty Falls Asleep**
- Same setup, but the host doesn't know where the car is
- Host opens a door at random (happens to be a goat)
- Should you switch?
- **Answer: NOW it's 50-50! The information value is different when the revelation is random vs. intentional**

**Variation 3: Quantum Monty Hall**
- Host offers you the option to switch BEFORE opening a door
- Should you commit to switching?
- **Answer: Yes, same logic applies**

**Python: 100-Door Variation:**

    print(f"  Switch: {switch_rate:.4%} (theoretical: {theoretical_switch:.4%})")
\`\`\`

**Interview Tips:**
1. Start by acknowledging this is the classic Monty Hall problem
2. Explain the key insight about information
3. Offer to show multiple solution methods
4. Discuss the psychological appeal of the wrong answer (status quo bias)
5. Be ready for variations!

**Real-World Connection:**
This problem is fundamentally about **information asymmetry** and **Bayesian updating**—both crucial in trading. When market makers or informed traders make moves, they're revealing information, just like Monty opening a door.

### Problem 2: The Birthday Paradox (Easy)

**Question:** How many people must be in a room for there to be a greater than 50% probability that at least two share a birthday?

**Hint 1:** It's easier to calculate the probability that ALL birthdays are different.

**Hint 2:** Use the complement rule: P(at least one match) = 1 - P(no matches)

**Hint 3:** The answer is surprisingly small!

---

**Solution:**

Assume 365 days in a year (ignore leap years). We want P(at least one match) > 0.5.

Calculate P(all different birthdays) for n people:

- Person 1: any birthday → probability 365/365 = 1
- Person 2: must differ from person 1 → probability 364/365
- Person 3: must differ from persons 1 and 2 → probability 363/365
- ...
- Person n: must differ from all previous → probability (365-n+1)/365

\`\`\`
P(all different) = (365/365) × (364/365) × (363/365) × ... × (365-n+1)/365
                 = 365! / [(365-n)! × 365^n]
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
P(at least one match) = 1 - P(all different)
\`\`\`

**Computing for small n:**

\`\`\`
n=10: P(match) ≈ 0.117 (11.7%)
n=20: P(match) ≈ 0.411 (41.1%)
n=23: P(match) ≈ 0.507 (50.7%) ✓ ANSWER
n=30: P(match) ≈ 0.706 (70.6%)
n=50: P(match) ≈ 0.970 (97.0%)
n=70: P(match) ≈ 0.999 (99.9%)
\`\`\`

**Answer: 23 people**

**Why is this counterintuitive?**

People often think linearly: "365 days, so you'd need ~183 people for 50% chance." But the number of possible pairs grows quadratically: with n people, there are n(n-1)/2 pairs.

For 23 people: 23 × 22 / 2 = 253 pairs of people who might share a birthday!

**Variations & Follow-ups:**

**Variation 1: Three-way match**
Q: How many people for P(three people share a birthday) > 0.5?
A: About 88 people

**Variation 2: Specific birthday**
Q: How many people needed for P(someone has YOUR birthday) > 0.5?
A: About 253 people (much more, because we're looking for a specific match!)

**Variation 3: Different calendar**
Q: If there were 500 days in a year, what would n be for 50% probability?
A: About 27 people (use n ≈ 1.2√days as approximation)

**Approximation Formula:**

For large number of days d and small n relative to d:

\`\`\`
P(match) ≈ 1 - e^(-n²/(2d))
\`\`\`

Setting this equal to 0.5 and solving for n:

\`\`\`
n ≈ √(2d ln(2)) ≈ 1.18√d
\`\`\`

For d=365: n ≈ 1.18√365 ≈ 22.5 ✓

**Interview Tips:**
1. State the complement approach immediately
2. Explain the quadratic growth of pairs
3. Show you understand the counterintuitive nature
4. Be ready to generalize (different number of days, three-way matches, etc.)
5. Mention the approximation formula if you know it

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Cryptography**: Hash collisions (birthday attack on hash functions)
- **Trading**: Probability of duplicate order IDs
- **Testing**: Collision probability in distributed systems

### Problem 3: Dice Problems Collection (Easy to Medium)

#### Problem 3A: Sum of Two Dice

**Question:** You roll two fair six-sided dice. What's the probability that:
a) The sum is 7?
b) The sum is even?
c) At least one die shows a 6?
d) The product is odd?

**Solution:**

Total outcomes: 6 × 6 = 36 (each die is independent)

**Part (a): P(sum = 7)**

Ways to get sum of 7:
- (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) → 6 ways

P(sum = 7) = 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667

**Part (b): P(sum is even)**

Sum is even when both dice are even OR both dice are odd:
- Both even: 3 × 3 = 9 ways
- Both odd: 3 × 3 = 9 ways
- Total: 18 ways

P(sum is even) = 18/36 = 1/2

Alternative: By symmetry, sum is equally likely to be even or odd, so P = 1/2.

**Part (c): P(at least one 6)**

Use complement: P(at least one 6) = 1 - P(no 6s)

P(no 6s) = (5/6) × (5/6) = 25/36

P(at least one 6) = 1 - 25/36 = 11/36 ≈ 0.306

**Part (d): P(product is odd)**

Product is odd only if BOTH dice show odd numbers (1, 3, or 5):

P(product odd) = (3/6) × (3/6) = 9/36 = 1/4

#### Problem 3B: N Dice Until All Faces Seen (Coupon Collector)

**Question:** You repeatedly roll a fair die. On average, how many rolls until you've seen all 6 faces at least once?

**This is the famous Coupon Collector's Problem!**

**Solution:**

Let T = number of rolls until all 6 faces seen.

Break into stages:
- Stage 1: Roll until you see first unique face → Expected rolls = 1 (certain)
- Stage 2: Roll until you see second unique face → Expected rolls = 6/5
- Stage 3: Roll until you see third unique face → Expected rolls = 6/4
- Stage 4: Roll until you see fourth unique face → Expected rolls = 6/3
- Stage 5: Roll until you see fifth unique face → Expected rolls = 6/2
- Stage 6: Roll until you see sixth unique face → Expected rolls = 6/1

\`\`\`
E[T] = 6/6 + 6/5 + 6/4 + 6/3 + 6/2 + 6/1
     = 6 × (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6)
     = 6 × (1 + 0.5 + 0.333 + 0.25 + 0.2 + 0.167)
     = 6 × 2.45
     ≈ 14.7 rolls
\`\`\`

**General Formula:**

For n equally likely outcomes:
\`\`\`
E[T] = n × H_n
\`\`\`

where H_n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n (the n-th harmonic number)

For large n: H_n ≈ ln(n) + γ, where γ ≈ 0.5772 (Euler-Mascheroni constant)

### Problem 4: Coin Flip Sequences (Medium)

#### Problem 4A: Expected Length of Longest Streak

**Question:** You flip a fair coin 100 times. What's the expected length of the longest streak of consecutive heads (or tails)?

**This is surprisingly hard analytically!**

**Approximate Solution:**

For n flips of a fair coin, the expected length of the longest streak is approximately:

\`\`\`
E[longest streak] ≈ log₂(n) - 0.6
\`\`\`

For n=100:
\`\`\`
E[longest streak] ≈ log₂(100) - 0.6 ≈ 6.64 - 0.6 ≈ 6.0 flips
\`\`\`

**More precise formula:**
\`\`\`
E[L_n] ≈ log₂(n) + γ/ln(2) - 1/2
\`\`\`

where γ ≈ 0.5772 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

#### Problem 4B: First Occurrence of HH vs HT

**Question:** You flip a fair coin repeatedly. Which appears first on average: HH or HT?

**Intuition check:** Many people think they're equally likely, but they're not!

**Answer:** HT appears first on average!

- E[flips until HH] = 6
- E[flips until HT] = 4

**Why?**

For **HH**: If you flip H then T, you have to start over. The T "wastes" the H.

For **HT**: If you flip H then H, the second H can still be the first H of your HT pattern.

**Rigorous Solution (Markov Chain):**

States: Start, H, HH (success)

Let E_0 = expected flips from Start, E_H = expected flips from H

\`\`\`
E_0 = 1 + (1/2)×E_H + (1/2)×E_0
E_H = 1 + (1/2)×0 + (1/2)×E_H

From second equation: E_H = 1 + (1/2)×E_H
                       (1/2)×E_H = 1
                       E_H = 2

From first equation:  E_0 = 1 + (1/2)×2 + (1/2)×E_0
                       (1/2)×E_0 = 2
                       E_0 = 4... wait, this isn't right!

Let me reconsider. For HH specifically:

States: Start, H, HH (done)

E_start = 1 + 0.5×E_H + 0.5×E_start
E_H = 1 + 0.5×0 + 0.5×E_start  (if we flip T after H, we go back to start!)

E_H = 1 + 0.5×E_start
E_start = 1 + 0.5×E_H + 0.5×E_start
E_start = 1 + 0.5×(1 + 0.5×E_start) + 0.5×E_start
E_start = 1 + 0.5 + 0.25×E_start + 0.5×E_start
E_start = 1.5 + 0.75×E_start
0.25×E_start = 1.5
E_start = 6
\`\`\`

For HT:

States: Start, H, HT (done)

E_start = 1 + 0.5×E_H + 0.5×E_start
E_H = 1 + 0.5×0 + 0.5×E_H  (if we flip H after H, we stay in state H!)

E_H = 1 + 0.5×E_H
0.5×E_H = 1
E_H = 2

E_start = 1 + 0.5×2 + 0.5×E_start
0.5×E_start = 2
E_start = 4

\`\`\`

**General Pattern Waiting Times:**

| Pattern | Expected Flips |
|---------|---------------|
| H       | 2             |
| HT      | 4             |
| HH      | 6             |
| HTH     | 10            |
| HTT     | 8             |
| HHH     | 14            |
