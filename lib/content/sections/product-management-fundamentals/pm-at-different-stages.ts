## Introduction

PM roles vary dramatically by company stage. A PM at a 10-person startup does completely different work than a PM at Google. Understanding these differences helps you choose the right role and succeed at each stage.

## Company Stages Overview

**Pre-Seed/Seed** (0-10 people, <$1M funding)  
**Series A** (10-50 people, $2-10M funding)  
**Series B** (50-200 people, $10-30M funding)  
**Series C+/Growth** (200-1000+ people, $30M+ funding)  
**Public Company** (1000+ people, publicly traded)

## PM at Pre-Seed/Seed Startup (0-10 people)

### **The Reality**

**Team**: Usually no dedicated PM (founder is PM)  
**If there is a PM**: You're often PM #1, maybe employee #5-10  
**Funding**: Bootstrapped or seed round ($500K-2M)  
**Users**: 0-1,000  
**Product**: Building MVP, finding PMF

### **PM Responsibilities**

**Your title might be**: Founding PM, Head of Product, or just "PM"

**What you actually do**:
- ✅ Everything (PM, designer, marketer, support, sometimes sales)
- ✅ Talk to users constantly (5-10 per week minimum)
- ✅ Build MVPs and test hypotheses rapidly
- ✅ Define product vision with founder
- ✅ Recruit early hires
- ✅ Wear every hat imaginable

**You DON'T do**:
- ❌ Long-term roadmaps (everything changes weekly)
- ❌ Process optimization (no process exists yet)
- ❌ Managing other PMs (you're the only one)
- ❌ Enterprise sales support (probably B2C or SMB)

### **Skills You'll Develop**

- **0→1 product building**: From idea to first customers
- **Scrappiness**: Build with zero resources
- **Speed**: Ship daily, iterate constantly
- **User empathy**: Talk to users so much you dream about them
- **Business sense**: Unit economics, fundraising, growth

### **When to Join**

**Join if**:
- Want to learn everything about building companies
- Can afford risk (might fail)
- Want significant equity (0.5-2%+)
- Thrive in chaos and ambiguity

**Don't join if**:
- Need structure and process
- Want mentorship from senior PMs
- Risk-averse (90% fail)
- Need high cash comp

### **Success Looks Like**

- Find product-market fit
- Reach $1M ARR
- Users love the product
- Ready for Series A

## Choosing the Right Stage for You

### **Ask Yourself**

**1. What's my risk tolerance?**
- High risk tolerance → Seed/Series A
- Low risk tolerance → Growth/Public

**2. What do I want to learn?**
- Breadth (how to build companies) → Seed/Series A
- Depth (how to scale products) → Growth/Public

**3. What's my financial situation?**
- Can afford low cash → Seed/Series A
- Need high cash → Growth/Public

**4. What matters more: equity or cash?**
- Equity → Seed/Series A
- Cash → Growth/Public

**5. Do I want process or chaos?**
- Chaos → Seed
- Process → Public
- Balanced → Series B/C

### **Career Stage Considerations**

**Early career (0-5 years)**:
- Consider: Series A/B (balance of learning + mentorship)
- Avoid: Seed (too chaotic without PM skills)
- Maybe: Public (great learning from senior PMs)

**Mid-career (5-10 years)**:
- Consider: Series B/C/Growth (leadership opportunities)
- Maybe: Seed (if you want founder path)
- Maybe: Public (if want to master craft)

**Late career (10+ years)**:
- Any stage works
- Seed: If you want equity upside
- Public: If you want to specialize deeply

## Switching Between Stages

### **Common Transitions**

**Public → Startup**:
- Bring: Process, scale expertise
- Learn: 0→1, speed, scrappiness
- Challenge: Less structure, faster pace

**Startup → Public**:
- Bring: Scrappiness, 0→1 skills
- Learn: Scale, process, depth
- Challenge: Slower pace, more bureaucracy

**Advice**: Give new stage 12 months before judging. Culture shock is real.

## Key Takeaways

1. **PM role varies dramatically by stage**
2. **Seed**: Everything, chaos, high risk, high equity
3. **Series A/B**: Balanced, great learning, moderate risk
4. **Growth**: Structure, specialization, lower risk
5. **Public**: Process, scale, low risk, high cash
6. **Choose based on**: Risk tolerance, learning goals, financial needs
7. **Early career**: Series A/B is often best (balance)
8. **No "best" stage**: Each teaches different skills
9. **You can switch**: Startup → corporate → startup
10. **12-month rule**: Give new stage time to adjust

## Practical Exercise

**Evaluate your current stage**:
- What stage is your company?
- What are you learning?
- Is this the right stage for you right now?
- Where do you want to be in 2 years?

**If misaligned**: Consider switching stages.

**Remember**: Your career is 40 years. Try different stages. Each teaches valuable lessons.
