const content = `# PM Core Competencies Framework

## Introduction

Product management requires mastering multiple disciplines simultaneously—strategy, user research, technical fluency, data analysis, design, communication, and leadership. This section provides a comprehensive framework for understanding PM competencies, assessing your current level, and building a development plan.

## The PM Competency Model

Great PMs excel across **7 core competency areas**. Think of these as muscles to develop:

\`\`\`
     Strategic Thinking
            ↓
    User Empathy ← → Technical Fluency
            ↓
      Data Analysis
            ↓
    Communication ← → Leadership
            ↓
       Execution
\`\`\`

Each competency has 5 levels of mastery:
- **Level 1**: Beginner (0-1 years)
