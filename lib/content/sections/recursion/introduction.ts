  title: 'Introduction to Recursion',
  content: `Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It's one of the most powerful and elegant problem-solving techniques in computer science.

**Why Recursion Matters:**
- **Natural Solution:** Many problems are naturally recursive (trees, graphs, divide-and-conquer)
- **Elegant Code:** Often shorter and more readable than iterative solutions
- **Essential Technique:** Required for DFS, backtracking, dynamic programming
- **Interview Favorite:** Common in technical interviews at all levels

**Real-World Applications:**
- **File Systems:** Traversing directory trees
- **Compilers:** Parsing nested expressions
- **Graphics:** Fractals and recursive rendering
- **Games:** Game tree search (chess, tic-tac-toe)
- **Data Processing:** Processing nested data structures (JSON, XML)

**Key Insight:**
Recursion breaks down complex problems into simpler subproblems of the same type. Each recursive call solves a smaller version until reaching a base case that can be solved directly.`,
