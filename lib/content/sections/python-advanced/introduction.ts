  title: 'Advanced Python: Beyond the Basics',
  content: `Advanced Python features allow you to write more elegant, efficient, and Pythonic code. These patterns are used extensively in production Python applications and frameworks.

**Why These Topics Matter:**
- **Decorators:** Modify function behavior without changing their code
- **Generators:** Memory-efficient iteration over large datasets
- **Context Managers:** Proper resource management and cleanup
- **Metaclasses:** Control class creation and behavior

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Decorators:** Authentication, logging, caching, rate limiting
- **Generators:** Processing large files, data pipelines, infinite sequences
- **Context Managers:** File handling, database connections, locks
- **Metaclasses:** ORMs (like Django models), singletons, API clients

**Key Insight:**
These advanced features are not just syntactic sugarâ€”they fundamentally change how you structure and think about your code, leading to more maintainable and performant applications.`,
