# 3. ML / OVERFITTING
# Explain: Why does adding more features sometimes hurt model performance?
def explain_overfitting():

    Answer:
    1. Curse of dimensionality: More features → need exponentially more data
    2. Spurious correlations: Random noise looks like signal in high dimensions

    4. Regularization needed: L1/L2 penalties, cross-validation
    
    Example:
    - 10 features, 1000 samples: Good (100 samples per feature)
    - 1000 features, 1000 samples: Overfitting (1 sample per feature!)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Compensation is excellent** across all paths ($200K-$900K mid-career)
2. **PhD opens doors** but isn't required (except top quant funds)
3. **Trade-offs exist**: Comp vs balance, equity vs cash, pure research vs applied
4. **Multiple entry points**: PhD, bootcamp → FAANG → finance, direct from undergrad
5. **Skills transfer**: Finance engineering → tech (and vice versa)

**Next section**: We'll explore **Financial Markets Explained** to understand where these roles operate.

**Remember**: Choose based on what problems excite you, not just compensation. A passionate fintech engineer at Stripe earning $400K is happier than a miserable quant researcher at Renaissance earning $800K.

Your engineering skills are valuable everywhere in finance. Pick the path that aligns with your interests! 🚀
