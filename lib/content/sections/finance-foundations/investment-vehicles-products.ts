# Investment Vehicles & Products

## Introduction

**Investment vehicles** are structures that hold and manage financial assets. Understanding these is critical for building financial systems because:

- **Different structures, different engineering**: ETFs need arbitrage mechanisms, mutual funds need NAV calculation
- **Regulatory differences**: Each vehicle has unique compliance requirements
- **Data requirements**: Different reporting standards, pricing mechanisms
- **User experience**: Different vehicles suit different user needs

This section covers all major investment products you'll encounter when building financial platforms.

## Individual Securities

### Stocks (Equities)

**Direct ownership** in companies. Most straightforward investment vehicle.

**Characteristics**:
- Trade on exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ)
- Real-time pricing during market hours
- No management fees (beyond brokerage commission)
- Tax: Capital gains when sold, dividends taxed annually

**Use Cases**:
- Active investors who pick stocks
- Long-term buy-and-hold investors
- Corporate insiders (own company stock)

## Mutual Funds

### Active Management

**Mutual funds** pool money from many investors to buy diversified portfolios, managed by professional portfolio managers.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Active management**: Manager picks stocks (vs passive index tracking)
- **End-of-day pricing**: NAV calculated once daily after market close
- **Higher fees**: Expense ratios 0.5-2% annually
- **Minimum investments**: Often $1,000-$10,000
- **Tax inefficient**: Capital gains distributed to all shareholders

**Net Asset Value (NAV) Calculation**:

\`\`\`
NAV = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Number of Shares Outstanding

Example:
Assets: $100M in stocks + $5M cash = $105M
Liabilities: $2M expenses = $2M
Shares Outstanding: 10M
NAV = (\$105M - $2M) / 10M = $10.30 per share

\`\`\`

**Pros**:
- Professional management
- Diversification (own hundreds of stocks with one purchase)
- Research and analysis included

**Cons**:
- Higher fees eat into returns
- Tax inefficient (you pay taxes on fund's trading)
- Only trade at end-of-day NAV (can't exit quickly)
- Most active funds underperform index

---

## Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

### Passive Index Tracking (Mostly)

**ETFs** combine best of stocks and mutual funds: diversification + real-time trading + low fees.

**Key Differences vs Mutual Funds**:

| Feature | ETF | Mutual Fund |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Trading** | Intraday (like stocks) | End-of-day only |
| **Pricing** | Real-time market price | NAV at 4pm |
| **Fees** | 0.03-0.50% | 0.5-2% |
| **Minimum** | Price of 1 share (~$50-500) | $1,000-10,000 |
| **Tax Efficiency** | High (in-kind redemptions) | Low (taxable distributions) |
| **Management** | Mostly passive | Mostly active |

\`\`\`

**Why This Matters for Engineers**:

The creation/redemption mechanism is **critical** to ETFs working. When you build:
- **Robo-advisors**: Need to understand ETF pricing for automatic rebalancing
- **Trading platforms**: ETF orders route differently than stocks
- **Risk systems**: ETFs track indices but can temporarily diverge

**Popular ETFs**:
- **SPY**: S&P 500 (\$450B AUM, 0.09% fee)
- **QQQ**: NASDAQ-100 (\$200B AUM, 0.20% fee)
- **VTI**: Total U.S. Stock Market (\$350B AUM, 0.03% fee)
- **AGG**: U.S. Aggregate Bonds (\$90B AUM, 0.03% fee)

## Target-Date Funds

### "Set It and Forget It"

**Target-date funds** automatically adjust asset allocation based on retirement date.

Age 25 (40 years to retirement):
- 90% stocks, 10% bonds

Age 45 (20 years to retirement):
- 70% stocks, 30% bonds

Age 65 (retirement):
- 40% stocks, 60% bonds

Age 75 (10 years into retirement):
- 30% stocks, 70% bonds

- Less control (can't adjust allocation)

## Robo-Advisors

### Automated Portfolio Management

**Robo-advisors** (Betterment, Wealthfront, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios) use algorithms to manage portfolios.

**How They Work**:
1. **Risk assessment**: Questionnaire determines risk tolerance
2. **Asset allocation**: Algorithm assigns target allocation
3. **Auto-rebalancing**: Maintains target allocation
4. **Tax-loss harvesting**: Automatically harvest losses for tax savings
5. **Dividend reinvestment**: Auto-reinvest dividends

### For Building Financial Products

When building a **robo-advisor**:
- Use ETFs (low fees, tax-efficient, liquid)
- Auto-rebalance quarterly (or threshold-based)
- Tax-loss harvest continuously
- Offer multiple risk profiles

When building a **trading platform**:
- Support all vehicle types (stocks, ETFs, mutual funds)
- Handle end-of-day NAV for mutual funds
- Real-time pricing for stocks/ETFs
- Fractional shares for accessibility
