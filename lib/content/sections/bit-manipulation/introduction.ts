  title: 'Introduction to Bit Manipulation',
  content: `**Bit manipulation** involves using bitwise operators to perform operations directly on the binary representations of numbers. This is one of the most efficient techniques in programming, often providing O(1) solutions to problems that would otherwise require more time and space.

**Why Learn Bit Manipulation?**
- **Ultra-efficient**: Operations are O(1) or O(log n)
- **Space-saving**: Usually requires O(1) extra space
- **Interview favorite**: Common in FAANG interviews
- **Practical applications**: Used in systems programming, cryptography, graphics, and optimization

**When to Use Bit Manipulation:**
- Finding single/missing elements in arrays
- Checking or manipulating specific bit positions
- Optimizing space usage (bit flags, bit sets)
- Mathematical operations (power of 2, counting set bits)
- Subset generation and manipulation`,
