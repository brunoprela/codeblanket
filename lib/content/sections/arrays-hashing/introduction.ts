  title: 'Arrays & Hash Tables: The Foundation',
  content: `Arrays and hash tables are the **most fundamental data structures** in computer science and appear in virtually every coding interview. Understanding these deeply is crucial for success.

**Why These Topics Matter:**
- **Arrays:** The most basic data structure, serving as building blocks for others
- **Hash Tables:** Provide O(1) average-case lookup, enabling powerful optimizations
- Together, they solve 30-40% of all interview problems

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Arrays:** Image processing (pixels), time series data, buffers
- **Hash Tables:** Caching systems, database indexing, symbol tables in compilers
- **Combined:** Frequency counting, grouping, deduplication

**Key Insight:**
Many O(nÂ²) brute force solutions can be optimized to O(n) using hash tables to store and lookup information instantly.`,
