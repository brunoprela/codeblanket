  title: 'Netflix Architecture',
  content: `Netflix is one of the world's largest streaming services, serving over 230 million subscribers across 190+ countries. Their architecture has evolved from a monolithic application to a highly scalable microservices-based system running entirely on AWS. This section explores the key components and patterns that enable Netflix to stream billions of hours of content monthly.

## Overview

Netflix's architecture is notable for several pioneering achievements:
- **700+ microservices** handling various aspects of the platform
- **Complete AWS infrastructure** (no on-premise data centers since 2016)
- **Chaos engineering pioneers** with tools like Chaos Monkey
- **Custom-built tools** like Zuul, Eureka, and Hystrix (now part of Netflix OSS)
- **Massive scale**: 15,000+ requests per second, petabytes of data

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Highly distributed**: Microservices communicate via REST APIs and messaging
2. **Resilient by design**: Assume failures will happen and build accordingly
3. **Horizontally scalable**: Scale individual components based on demand
4. **Polyglot**: Teams choose the best language/tools for their service (Java, Node.js, Python, etc.)
5. **DevOps culture**: "You build it, you run it" philosophy

## High-Level Architecture

### Three-Tier Structure

**1. Client Layer**
- Web, mobile, smart TVs, game consoles, streaming devices
- Each has custom UI but shares backend APIs
- Adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) for optimal quality

**2. Backend Services Layer**
- 700+ microservices handling different functionalities
- API Gateway (Zuul) routes requests to appropriate services
- Services communicate asynchronously when possible

**3. Data Layer**
- Multiple specialized data stores (Cassandra, EVCache, S3, etc.)
- No single database for all data
- Polyglot persistence based on access patterns

---

## Core Components

### 1. API Gateway - Zuul

Zuul is Netflix's edge service that acts as the front door for all requests from devices.

**Responsibilities**:
- **Dynamic routing**: Route requests to appropriate backend services
- **Traffic shaping**: Load balancing, rate limiting, throttling
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, SSL termination
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, timeouts
- **Monitoring**: Request logging, metrics collection
- **A/B testing**: Route traffic for experiments

**How it works**:
\`\`\`
Client Request → Zuul Gateway → Pre-filters (auth, rate limiting)
                              → Routing filter (select backend)
                              → Post-filters (logging, metrics)
                              → Response to client
\`\`\`

**Filter Types**:
- **PRE filters**: Execute before routing (authentication, rate limiting, request transformation)
- **ROUTE filters**: Handle routing to backend (dynamic routing, load balancing)
- **POST filters**: Execute after backend response (metrics, logging, response transformation)
- **ERROR filters**: Execute when errors occur (error handling, fallbacks)

**Key Features**:
- Written in Java, uses Netty for non-blocking I/O
- Filters can be added/modified without redeploying
- Handles 50,000+ requests per second per instance
- Auto-scaling based on traffic

**Evolution**: Netflix is moving from Zuul 1 (blocking) to Zuul 2 (non-blocking with Netty) for better performance.

---

### 2. Service Discovery - Eureka

Eureka is Netflix's service registry for locating services for load balancing and failover.

**Problem it solves**: In a microservices architecture with hundreds of services, how do services find each other? IP addresses change, instances scale up/down, services may be deployed across multiple regions.

**How Eureka works**:

1. **Service Registration**:
   - Each service instance registers with Eureka Server on startup
   - Provides metadata: hostname, port, health check URL, status
   - Sends heartbeats every 30 seconds to renew lease

2. **Service Discovery**:
   - Clients fetch registry from Eureka Server
   - Cache registry locally for resilience
   - Refresh every 30 seconds

3. **Health Checks**:
   - Eureka Server expects heartbeats
   - If no heartbeat for 90 seconds, instance evicted
   - Self-preservation mode during network issues

**Architecture**:
\`\`\`
Service A (registers) → Eureka Server (registry)
                              ↓
Service B (discovers) ← Eureka Client (cached registry)
Service B → Load Balancer (Ribbon) → Service A instance
\`\`\`

**Key Benefits**:
- **Client-side load balancing**: Clients choose instance to call (using Ribbon)
- **Resilience**: Local cache survives Eureka Server outage
- **Multi-region support**: Regional Eureka clusters with cross-region replication
- **Zero-downtime deployment**: Instances removed from registry during deployment

**Production Setup**:
- Eureka Servers in multiple availability zones
- Peer-to-peer replication between servers
- Each region has its own Eureka cluster
- Services prefer same-zone instances to reduce latency/cost

---

### 3. Circuit Breaker - Hystrix

Hystrix is Netflix's latency and fault tolerance library, providing circuit breaker pattern implementation.

**Problem it solves**: In a distributed system, one slow service can cascade and bring down the entire system. A failing dependency consuming threads can lead to resource exhaustion.

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**:

**States**:
1. **CLOSED** (normal): Requests flow through, failures counted
2. **OPEN** (failing): Requests fail immediately, no backend calls
3. **HALF_OPEN** (testing): Limited requests allowed to test recovery

**How Hystrix works**:

1. **Wrap calls** in HystrixCommand
2. **Execute** the command
3. **Monitor** success/failure rates
4. **Trip circuit** if error threshold exceeded (e.g., 50% failures in 10 seconds)
5. **Fail fast** while circuit is open
6. **Test recovery** periodically (half-open state)
7. **Close circuit** if backend recovers

**Example**:
\`\`\`
Normal: 100 requests → 95 succeed → Circuit CLOSED
Failure: 100 requests → 60 fail → Circuit OPENS
Fast Fail: Next 1000 requests fail immediately (no backend calls)
Recovery: After 5 seconds, allow 1 request (HALF_OPEN)
Success: Request succeeds → Circuit CLOSES
\`\`\`

**Key Features**:

**1. Fallback Support**:
- Return cached data
- Return default value
- Return degraded experience
- Return error message

**2. Bulkhead Isolation**:
- Separate thread pools per dependency
- One slow service doesn't consume all threads
- Limits blast radius of failures

**3. Request Collapsing**:
- Batch multiple requests into one
- Reduces network round trips
- Example: 10 requests for user data → 1 batch API call

**4. Real-time Metrics**:
- Success rate, error rate, latency percentiles
- Circuit breaker state
- Thread pool utilization
- Dashboard for visualization (Hystrix Dashboard)

**Configuration**:
\`\`\`
Timeout: 1000ms (fail if dependency doesn't respond)
Error threshold: 50% (trip circuit if >50% failures)
Request volume threshold: 20 (need 20 requests before tripping)
Sleep window: 5000ms (wait 5s before trying half-open)
Thread pool size: 10 (max concurrent requests)
\`\`\`

**Note**: Hystrix is now in maintenance mode. Netflix has moved to Resilience4j and other alternatives, but Hystrix remains influential and widely used.

---

### 4. Client-Side Load Balancing - Ribbon

Ribbon provides client-side load balancing, integrating with Eureka for service discovery.

**Why client-side?**: Traditional load balancers (hardware or software) are potential bottlenecks. Client-side load balancing distributes decision-making, eliminating single point of failure.

**How Ribbon works**:

1. **Get service instances** from Eureka
2. **Apply load balancing rule** to select instance
3. **Make request** to selected instance
4. **Track statistics** (response time, errors)
5. **Avoid unhealthy instances** based on stats

**Load Balancing Rules**:

- **RoundRobinRule**: Cycle through instances
- **WeightedResponseTimeRule**: Favor faster instances
- **AvailabilityFilteringRule**: Skip instances with circuit trippers or high concurrent connections
- **RandomRule**: Random selection
- **RetryRule**: Retry on failed instances
- **BestAvailableRule**: Select instance with lowest concurrent requests

**Integration with Hystrix**:
\`\`\`
Request → Ribbon (select instance) → Hystrix (circuit breaker) → Backend
\`\`\`

**Key Benefits**:
- No single point of failure (distributed load balancing)
- Aware of zone/region for cost optimization
- Integrates failure detection (via Hystrix)
- Customizable rules for specific use cases

---

## Data Storage Layer

Netflix uses **polyglot persistence** - different data stores for different access patterns.

### 1. Cassandra (Primary Data Store)

**Use Cases**:
- User viewing history
- Personalization data
- Customer profiles
- Content metadata

**Why Cassandra?**:
- **Highly available**: Multi-region, multi-datacenter replication
- **Linearly scalable**: Add nodes to increase capacity
- **No single point of failure**: Peer-to-peer architecture
- **Tunable consistency**: Choose consistency level per query
- **Optimized for time-series data**: Viewing history is time-based

**Netflix's Cassandra Setup**:
- Largest deployment: 1,000+ nodes per cluster
- Millions of operations per second
- Terabytes of data per cluster
- Replication factor: 3 (data on 3 nodes)
- Consistency level: LOCAL_QUORUM (majority in same datacenter)

**Data Model Example** (Viewing History):
\`\`\`
Table: viewing_history
Partition Key: user_id
Clustering Key: timestamp DESC
Columns: title_id, duration, device, completion_percentage

Query: "Get viewing history for user X" → Single partition read (fast)
\`\`\`

**Challenges**:
- Tombstone accumulation (deleted records)
- Compaction overhead
- Operational complexity

**Tools**:
- **Priam**: Backup/restore, auto-configuration
- **Astyanax**: Java client with connection pooling, retry logic

---

### 2. EVCache (Distributed Memcached)

EVCache is Netflix's distributed in-memory caching solution, built on Memcached.

**Why Caching?**:
- Reduce latency (sub-millisecond response times)
- Reduce load on backend databases
- Handle traffic spikes

**EVCache Architecture**:
\`\`\`
Client → EVCache Client Library
              → Replicate to multiple zones (Zone A, B, C)
              → Each zone has Memcached cluster
\`\`\`

**Key Features**:

**1. Multi-Zone Replication**:
- Write to all zones simultaneously
- Read from nearest zone (lowest latency)
- Survives zone failures

**2. Warm-Up Strategy**:
- Pre-populate cache before taking traffic
- Gradual ramp-up to avoid thundering herd

**3. Resilience**:
- Automatic failover to other zones
- Circuit breakers for unhealthy caches
- Fallback to database if cache fails

**Use Cases**:
- API responses (homepage, recommendations)
- User session data
- Frequently accessed metadata
- Computed results (personalization scores)

**Performance**:
- P99 latency: <1ms
- Millions of operations per second
- Cache hit rate: 90%+

---

### 3. Amazon S3 (Object Storage)

S3 stores all media assets and large binary objects.

**Stored Content**:
- **Video files**: Master files, transcoded versions
- **Images**: Movie posters, thumbnails, promotional images
- **Subtitles and metadata**: Captions, descriptions

**Why S3?**:
- **Durability**: 11 nines (99.999999999%)
- **Scalability**: Infinite storage
- **Cost-effective**: Cheaper than building own storage
- **Integration**: Works with CDN (CloudFront) seamlessly

**Content Organization**:
\`\`\`
/titles/
  /title_123/
    /video/
      master.mp4
      1080p.mp4
      720p.mp4
      480p.mp4
    /images/
      poster.jpg
      thumbnail.jpg
    /subtitles/
      en.vtt
      es.vtt
\`\`\`

**Access Pattern**:
- Write once (during content ingestion/encoding)
- Read millions of times (streaming)
- Heavy use of CDN to reduce S3 requests

---

### 4. Time-Series Databases (Atlas)

Atlas is Netflix's internal time-series database for metrics and monitoring.

**Use Cases**:
- Application metrics (request rate, error rate, latency)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network)
- Business metrics (signups, playback starts, cancellations)

**Key Features**:
- **High write throughput**: Millions of data points per second
- **Fast queries**: Millisecond latency for dashboards
- **Flexible queries**: Aggregations, filters, grouping
- **Data retention**: Configurable per metric (hours to years)

**Data Model**:
\`\`\`
Metric: request_count
Tags: service=user-service, region=us-east-1, status=200
Value: 1500 (requests per second)
Timestamp: 2024-10-24T12:00:00Z
\`\`\`

**Integration**:
- Services publish metrics via client library
- Atlas aggregates and stores
- Grafana-like dashboards visualize
- Alerting based on metric thresholds

---

## Video Encoding and Delivery

### Encoding Pipeline

Netflix encodes content into hundreds of versions to support:
- Different resolutions (4K, 1080p, 720p, 480p, etc.)
- Different bitrates (adaptive streaming)
- Different codecs (H.264, H.265/HEVC, VP9, AV1)
- Different audio tracks (languages, surround sound)
- Different subtitle tracks

**Process**:

1. **Content Ingestion**:
   - Studios upload master file (high quality)
   - Stored in S3

2. **Transcoding**:
   - Distributed encoding jobs to EC2 instances
   - Encode multiple versions in parallel
   - Use spot instances for cost savings (70% cheaper)

3. **Quality Validation**:
   - Automated quality checks (visual artifacts, audio sync)
   - Machine learning models detect encoding issues

4. **Packaging**:
   - Package for streaming protocols (DASH, HLS)
   - Generate manifest files

5. **Distribution**:
   - Upload encoded files to S3
   - Distribute to CDN (Open Connect)

**Optimization**:
- **Per-title encoding**: Optimize bitrate for each title (simple animation vs action movie)
- **Per-scene encoding**: Adjust bitrate per scene (dark scene vs bright scene)
- **Parallel encoding**: Thousands of concurrent encoding jobs
- **Encoding time**: ~1 hour for 2-hour movie (with massive parallelization)

---

### Content Delivery Network (CDN) - Open Connect

Netflix built their own CDN called **Open Connect** for optimal video delivery.

**Why Build Own CDN?**:
- **Cost**: Cheaper than using third-party CDNs at Netflix's scale
- **Control**: Optimize for video streaming specifically
- **Quality**: Better control over user experience
- **Scale**: Netflix accounts for ~15% of global internet traffic

**Architecture**:

**Open Connect Appliances (OCAs)**:
- Specialized servers optimized for video delivery
- 230+ TB storage per appliance
- Deployed in ISP networks (Comcast, Verizon, etc.) and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)
- ~18,000 servers in 6,000+ locations worldwide

**How it works**:

1. **Content Pre-positioning**:
   - Predict which content will be popular in each region
   - Pre-cache popular titles to OCAs at night (off-peak hours)
   - Use viewing patterns, recommendations, popularity trends

2. **Request Routing**:
   - Client requests video → Netflix backend
   - Backend returns CDN URL (nearest OCA)
   - Client streams directly from OCA

3. **Cache Miss Handling**:
   - If content not on OCA, fetch from S3 via AWS backbone
   - Cache for future requests

**Benefits**:
- **Low latency**: Content served from ISP's network (no internet hops)
- **High quality**: Reduced buffering, higher bitrates possible
- **ISP benefits**: Reduced transit costs (Netflix traffic stays local)

**Traffic Patterns**:
- Peak: 8 PM - 11 PM (evening viewing)
- Pre-fill: 2 AM - 6 AM (off-peak content distribution)

---

## Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)

Netflix uses adaptive bitrate streaming to provide optimal quality based on network conditions.

**How it works**:

1. **Multiple Versions**:
   - Each video encoded at multiple bitrates
   - Example: 4K (25 Mbps), 1080p (8 Mbps), 720p (5 Mbps), 480p (2 Mbps)

2. **Client-Side Logic**:
   - Client measures available bandwidth
   - Selects appropriate bitrate
   - Switches bitrate as network changes

3. **Chunked Delivery**:
   - Video divided into small chunks (2-10 seconds)
   - Client requests chunks sequentially
   - Can change bitrate between chunks

**Algorithm**:
\`\`\`
while playing:
    measure_bandwidth()
    if bandwidth > current_bitrate * 1.5:
        switch_to_higher_bitrate()
    elif bandwidth < current_bitrate * 0.8:
        switch_to_lower_bitrate()
    else:
        maintain_current_bitrate()
\`\`\`

**Buffer Management**:
- Maintain 15-30 second buffer
- If buffer depletes → switch to lower bitrate
- If buffer full and bandwidth high → switch to higher bitrate

**User Experience**:
- Minimize buffering (most important)
- Maximize quality (when possible)
- Smooth transitions (avoid quality oscillations)

---

## Personalization and Recommendation

Netflix's recommendation system drives ~80% of viewing activity.

**Components**:

**1. User Profile**:
- Viewing history
- Ratings (thumbs up/down)
- Search queries
- Browsing behavior (what you hover over)
- Device, time of day, day of week

**2. Content Metadata**:
- Genre, actors, director
- Tone (dark, light, serious, comedic)
- Themes (romance, action, mystery)
- Maturity rating

**3. Machine Learning Models**:
- **Collaborative filtering**: "Users similar to you watched X"
- **Content-based filtering**: "You watched Y, so you might like X (similar genre)"
- **Deep learning**: Neural networks for complex patterns
- **Contextual bandits**: Optimize which artwork to show

**Recommendation Types**:
- **Personalized homepage**: Different for each user
- **Top 10 lists**: Personalized per user and region
- **Because you watched X**: Similar titles
- **Trending now**: Popular in your region
- **New releases**: Recently added content

**Real-Time Updates**:
- Recommendations update as you watch
- If you binge-watch a genre, more suggestions in that genre
- A/B testing: Different algorithms for different users

**Scale**:
- Process billions of events per day
- Train models on petabytes of viewing data
- Inference: Sub-second latency for recommendation requests

---

## Chaos Engineering

Netflix pioneered chaos engineering - intentionally injecting failures to test resilience.

**Philosophy**: "If you don't try breaking things, you don't know if they're truly resilient."

### Chaos Monkey

The original chaos tool, randomly terminates EC2 instances during business hours.

**How it works**:
1. Select random instance from production
2. Terminate instance (kill it)
3. Monitor system behavior
4. Verify: Did services recover? Was user experience affected?

**Benefits**:
- Forces teams to build resilient services
- Uncovers hidden dependencies
- Validates automatic failover mechanisms
- Builds confidence in system reliability

### Simian Army (Family of Tools)

**Chaos Kong**: Simulates entire AWS region failure
**Latency Monkey**: Introduces artificial delays
**Conformity Monkey**: Shuts down instances not following best practices
**Doctor Monkey**: Checks for unhealthy instances
**Janitor Monkey**: Cleans up unused resources
**Security Monkey**: Checks for security vulnerabilities

**Principles**:
1. **Start small**: Begin with non-critical services
2. **Business hours**: Failures during working hours (engineers available to fix)
3. **Gradual rollout**: Increase chaos intensity over time
4. **Automated recovery**: Systems should recover automatically
5. **Learn and improve**: Each failure is a learning opportunity

**Culture Impact**:
- Teams proactively build resilience
- On-call burden reduced (fewer surprises)
- Faster incident response (teams practice recovery)

---

## Observability and Monitoring

Netflix processes massive amounts of telemetry data to ensure system health.

### Metrics Collection

**Atlas** (mentioned earlier) collects metrics from all services.

**Key Metrics**:
- **RED metrics**: Rate, Errors, Duration
- **System metrics**: CPU, memory, network, disk I/O
- **Business metrics**: Signups, cancellations, playback starts

**Collection Method**:
- Services publish metrics via client library
- 1-second granularity
- Millions of metrics per second

### Distributed Tracing

Netflix uses **Zipkin** (later evolved to other tools) for distributed tracing.

**Why?**: A single user request might traverse 50+ microservices. Tracing shows the path and identifies bottlenecks.

**How it works**:
1. Generate unique trace ID for each request
2. Pass trace ID through all service calls
3. Each service logs span (service name, duration, result)
4. Collect spans in central store
5. Visualize trace (service dependency graph, latency breakdown)

**Example**:
\`\`\`
User clicks "Play" → Trace ID: abc123

Span 1: API Gateway (10ms)
Span 2: Auth Service (5ms)
Span 3: User Profile Service (20ms)
Span 4: Recommendation Service (50ms) ← SLOW!
Span 5: Licensing Service (8ms)
Span 6: CDN URL Service (5ms)
Total: 98ms

Insight: Recommendation Service is the bottleneck
\`\`\`

### Centralized Logging

All service logs aggregated for search and analysis.

**Tools**:
- **Elasticsearch**: Store and index logs
- **Kibana**: Search and visualize logs
- **Log shippers**: Collect logs from instances

**Use Cases**:
- Debugging production issues
- Auditing (who did what, when)
- Security analysis (detect anomalies)
- Trend analysis (error rate patterns)

### Alerting

Alerts based on metrics and anomalies.

**Alert Types**:
- **Threshold alerts**: Error rate > 5%
- **Anomaly detection**: Traffic 50% lower than expected
- **Synthetic monitoring**: Simulate user actions, alert if failed

**Alert Routing**:
- Critical: Page on-call engineer immediately
- Warning: Ticket for next business day
- Info: Log for review

**Alert Fatigue Prevention**:
- High bar for alerts (only actionable items)
- Auto-resolve when issue clears
- Aggregate similar alerts (1 alert for 100 failing instances, not 100 alerts)

---

## Deployment and Release

Netflix deploys thousands of times per day across their microservices.

### Continuous Delivery Pipeline

**Spinnaker** is Netflix's multi-cloud continuous delivery platform.

**Deployment Process**:

1. **Build**:
   - Code commit triggers CI pipeline
   - Run tests (unit, integration)
   - Build Docker container or AMI

2. **Bake**:
   - Create immutable image (AMI)
   - Include application and dependencies

3. **Deploy**:
   - **Canary deployment**: Deploy to small percentage of instances (5%)
   - Monitor metrics for 1-2 hours
   - If healthy, proceed; if not, rollback

4. **Full Rollout**:
   - Gradually increase to 25%, 50%, 100%
   - Monitor at each stage

5. **Verification**:
   - Automated tests verify functionality
   - Real user traffic validates performance

**Rollback**:
- One-click rollback to previous version
- Automated rollback if error rate spikes

### Blue-Green Deployment

For larger changes or data layer migrations:

1. **Blue environment**: Current production
2. **Green environment**: New version running in parallel
3. **Traffic shift**: Gradually route traffic to green
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for issues
5. **Cutover**: Full traffic to green, blue becomes backup

**Benefits**:
- Zero downtime
- Easy rollback (shift traffic back to blue)
- Test with real traffic

---

## Regional Isolation and Disaster Recovery

Netflix operates in multiple AWS regions for resilience.

### Multi-Region Architecture

**Primary Regions**:
- us-east-1 (primary)
- us-west-2
- eu-west-1

**Regional Isolation**:
- Each region is self-sufficient
- Can lose entire region without impacting others
- Traffic routed to healthy regions

**Data Replication**:
- Cassandra: Multi-region replication (eventual consistency)
- S3: Cross-region replication for critical data
- EVCache: Regional caches (not replicated)

### Failure Scenarios

**Instance Failure**:
- Auto-scaling replaces failed instance
- Load balancer routes around failure
- Impact: None (handled automatically)

**Availability Zone Failure**:
- Services deployed across 3 AZs
- Lose 1 AZ, 2 remain (66% capacity)
- Auto-scaling adds capacity in healthy AZs
- Impact: Minimal (slight performance degradation)

**Region Failure**:
- DNS routes traffic to healthy regions
- Users may see slight latency increase (if routed to farther region)
- Impact: Moderate (some regions may have degraded performance)

**Chaos Kong** exercises simulate region failures quarterly.

---

## Key Lessons from Netflix Architecture

### 1. Embrace Failure

Design systems expecting failures:
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Bulkheads isolate failures
- Chaos engineering validates resilience

### 2. Decentralization

Avoid single points of failure:
- Client-side load balancing (Ribbon)
- No central message bus (point-to-point communication)
- Regional isolation

### 3. Polyglot Persistence

Choose the right tool for each job:
- Cassandra for high write throughput
- EVCache for low latency reads
- S3 for object storage
- Atlas for time-series data

### 4. Observability is Critical

You can't fix what you can't see:
- Comprehensive metrics (millions per second)
- Distributed tracing (end-to-end visibility)
- Centralized logging (debugging in production)

### 5. Automation Over Manual Processes

Scale requires automation:
- Auto-scaling for capacity
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Self-healing infrastructure

### 6. DevOps Culture

Teams own their services end-to-end:
- Build, deploy, monitor, on-call
- Freedom to choose tools
- Accountability for reliability

## Common Interview Questions

**Q: How does Netflix handle a service failure?**

A: Multiple layers of resilience: (1) Circuit breakers (Hystrix) prevent cascading failures by failing fast. (2) Bulkhead isolation ensures one service's failure doesn't consume all threads. (3) Fallbacks provide degraded experience (cached data, default values). (4) Auto-scaling replaces failed instances. (5) Graceful degradation (e.g., recommendations fail → show generic popular content). Example: If recommendation service is down, homepage still loads with trending content instead of personalized recommendations.

**Q: How does Netflix achieve low latency for video streaming?**

A: Multi-layered approach: (1) Open Connect CDN with 18,000+ servers in ISP networks reduces network hops. (2) Content pre-positioning: Popular content cached locally before peak hours. (3) EVCache for metadata (sub-millisecond reads). (4) Adaptive bitrate streaming adjusts quality to available bandwidth. (5) Multi-region deployment ensures users connect to nearby region. Result: P50 latency for metadata API calls <50ms, P99 <200ms. Video buffering events <1% of plays.

**Q: How does Netflix deploy changes to production without downtime?**

A: Continuous delivery with Spinnaker: (1) Canary deployment to 5% of instances. (2) Monitor metrics (error rate, latency, business metrics) for 1-2 hours. (3) Automated health checks validate functionality. (4) Gradual rollout to 25%, 50%, 100% with monitoring at each stage. (5) Automated rollback if metrics degrade. (6) Blue-green deployment for larger changes. (7) Feature flags to decouple deployment from release. Netflix does thousands of deployments per day with minimal incidents.

**Q: What is the purpose of Netflix's Chaos Monkey?**

A: Chaos Monkey randomly terminates production instances during business hours to validate resilience. Purpose: (1) Force teams to build resilient services (can't rely on instances staying alive). (2) Uncover hidden dependencies. (3) Validate automatic failover and recovery mechanisms. (4) Build confidence that systems can handle failures. (5) Reduce surprises during actual incidents (teams practice recovery regularly). Culture impact: Teams proactively design for failure rather than reactively fixing issues. Extends to Simian Army (Chaos Kong for region failures, Latency Monkey for network delays, etc.).
