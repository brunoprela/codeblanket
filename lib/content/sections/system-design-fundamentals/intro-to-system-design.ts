  title: 'Introduction to System Design Interviews',
  content: `System design interviews are a critical component of technical interviews at top tech companies. Unlike coding interviews that test your algorithmic skills, system design interviews evaluate your ability to build large-scale distributed systems.

## What is a System Design Interview?

A system design interview is a **collaborative discussion** where you're asked to design a complex software system from scratch. You'll need to:
- Gather requirements and clarify ambiguities
- Define the scope and constraints
- Design the high-level architecture
- Dive deep into critical components
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Address scalability, reliability, and performance

**Not a Coding Interview**: You won't write code. Instead, you'll draw diagrams, discuss architectural patterns, and explain your reasoning.

## Why Companies Use System Design Interviews

### **Evaluate Real-World Skills**
Companies want to know if you can:
- Design systems that serve millions of users
- Make architectural decisions
- Think about scalability and reliability
- Communicate complex ideas clearly
- Work collaboratively with teams

### **Assess Seniority Level**
System design interviews are typically used for:
- **Senior Engineers**: Expected to design components
- **Staff Engineers**: Expected to design systems
- **Principal Engineers**: Expected to design platforms

### **Predict On-the-Job Performance**
These interviews simulate actual work:
- Architecture reviews
- Design documents
- Technical discussions
- Trade-off analysis

## What Interviewers Look For

### **1. Structured Thinking**
Do you approach problems systematically or jump randomly between topics?

**Good**: "Let me start by clarifying requirements, then estimate scale, then discuss high-level architecture..."

**Bad**: "We need a database... and maybe Redis... oh wait, what about load balancers?"

### **2. Communication Skills**
Can you explain complex ideas clearly?
- Use diagrams effectively
- Define terms before using them
- Check for understanding
- Think out loud

### **3. Technical Depth**
Do you understand how systems actually work?
- Not just buzzwords ("use microservices!")
- Actual implementation details
- Performance characteristics
- Failure modes

### **4. Trade-off Analysis**
Every decision has trade-offs. Can you identify and discuss them?

**Example**: "We could use strong consistency for better data accuracy, but this would increase latency. For a social media feed, eventual consistency might be acceptable since users don't need real-time updates."

### **5. Practical Experience**
Have you built real systems?
- Specific examples from past work
- Awareness of production challenges
- Knowledge of actual tools and technologies

## Common System Design Interview Questions

### **Level 1 (Entry/Mid-Level)**
- Design a URL shortener (like bit.ly)
- Design a key-value store (like Redis)
- Design a rate limiter
- Design a pastebin (like pastebin.com)

### **Level 2 (Senior)**
- Design Instagram
- Design Twitter
- Design Uber
- Design Netflix
- Design WhatsApp

### **Level 3 (Staff+)**
- Design Google Drive
- Design YouTube
- Design Amazon
- Design Facebook News Feed
- Design global-scale payment system

## Interview Duration and Expectations

### **Typical Format (45-60 minutes)**

**Minutes 0-10**: Requirements gathering
- Clarify ambiguous requirements
- Define scope
- Establish constraints

**Minutes 10-20**: High-level design
- Draw architecture diagram
- Identify major components
- Explain data flow

**Minutes 20-40**: Deep dive
- Focus on 2-3 critical components
- Discuss scalability
- Address bottlenecks

**Minutes 40-45**: Wrap up
- Discuss trade-offs
- Handle edge cases
- Answer follow-up questions

### **Red Flags to Avoid**
❌ Starting to design without asking questions
❌ Over-engineering simple problems
❌ Ignoring scale and performance
❌ Not explaining your thinking
❌ Being defensive about feedback
❌ Using buzzwords without understanding

---

## Success Metrics

You're doing well if you:
✅ Ask clarifying questions
✅ Make reasonable assumptions
✅ Explain trade-offs
✅ Identify bottlenecks
✅ Respond to feedback
✅ Complete the design in time
✅ Communicate clearly

## Real-World Example: Netflix Interview

**Question**: "Design a video streaming service like Netflix."

**What interviewers are testing**:
- Can you handle massive scale? (200M+ users)
- Do you understand video streaming? (CDN, encoding, bitrates)
- Can you design for availability? (99.99% uptime)
- Do you know about content delivery? (edge caching)

**Key components**:
- Video storage and encoding
- Content delivery network (CDN)
- User authentication and profiles
- Recommendation engine
- Payment processing
- Admin tools

This tests your knowledge of: storage systems, CDNs, microservices, databases, caching, load balancing, and more.`,
