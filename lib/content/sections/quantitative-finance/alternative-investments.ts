# Alternative Investments

## Introduction

Alternative investments are assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds-hedge funds, private equity, real estate, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. These assets offer diversification benefits, inflation hedging, and access to return sources uncorrelated with public markets.

**Why alternatives matter:**
- **Diversification**: Low correlation (0.2-0.5) with equities reduces portfolio volatility
- **Absolute returns**: Hedge funds target positive returns regardless of market direction
- **Illiquidity premium**: Private equity earns 2-5% premium over public equities for lockup risk
- **Inflation hedging**: Commodities and real estate offset purchasing power erosion
- **Access to unique strategies**: Venture capital, distressed debt, merger arbitrage

**Institutional adoption:** Yale endowment allocates 50%+ to alternatives (David Swensen\'s "Yale Model"), earning 12-13% annually (1985-2020) vs 9% for 60/40 portfolio.

**Challenges:**
- **Illiquidity**: 5-10 year lockups (private equity, venture capital)
- **High fees**: 2% management + 20% performance ("2 and 20")
- **Complexity**: Difficult to evaluate, monitor, and benchmark
- **Access barriers**: Accredited investor requirements, high minimums ($250k-$10M)

This section provides comprehensive coverage of each alternative asset class, including structures, return drivers, risks, valuation methodologies, and portfolio construction frameworks.

## Hedge Funds

### Definition

**Hedge funds** are actively managed investment vehicles that employ diverse strategies to generate absolute returns (positive returns regardless of market direction).

**Legal structure:** Limited partnership (LP).
- **General Partner (GP)**: Fund manager (2% management fee + 20% performance fee)
- **Limited Partners (LPs)**: Investors (provide capital, limited liability)

**Key characteristics:**
- **Flexibility**: Can short sell, use leverage, trade derivatives
- **Absolute return target**: 8-12% regardless of market conditions
- **Low correlation**: 0.3-0.6 with equities (diversification benefit)
- **High fees**: "2 and 20" (2% annually on AUM + 20% of profits above high-water mark)

**High-water mark:** Manager only earns performance fees on new highs (prevents charging fees on same gains twice).

**Example:** Fund starts at $100M.
- Year 1: Returns 20% → $120M (manager earns 2% × $100M + 20% × $20M = $2M + $4M = $6M)
- Year 2: Returns -10% → $108M (manager earns 2% × $120M = $2.4M, no performance fee because below high-water mark of $120M)
- Year 3: Returns 15% → $124.2M (manager earns 2% × $108M + 20% × (\$124.2M - $120M) = $2.16M + $0.84M = $3M)

### Hedge Fund Strategies

**1. Long-Short Equity**

**Strategy:** Long undervalued stocks, short overvalued stocks (market-neutral or net long).

**Example:** 130/30 strategy.
- Long: $130M (130% of capital)
- Short: $30M (30% of capital)
- Net exposure: 100% (130% - 30%)
- Gross exposure: 160% (130% + 30%)

**Alpha sources:**
- **Stock selection**: Fundamental analysis, quantitative models
- **Sector rotation**: Overweight value, underweight growth
- **Event-driven**: M&A, earnings, restructurings

**Performance:**
- **Target return**: 10-15% annually
- **Sharpe ratio**: 0.8-1.2
- **Correlation with S&P 500**: 0.5-0.7 (partially hedged)
- **Typical leverage**: 1.3-1.5×

**Risk:** Short squeezes (shorts rally sharply, causing losses).

**Example:** 2020 GameStop short squeeze.
- Melvin Capital short GME at $20
- Reddit WallStreetBets rallies GME to $400
- Melvin loses $7B, requires $2.75B bailout

**2. Global Macro**

**Strategy:** Top-down bets on currencies, interest rates, commodities, equities based on macroeconomic analysis.

**Famous examples:**
- **George Soros (1992)**: Short British pound, profit $1B ("broke the Bank of England")
- **Ray Dalio (Bridgewater)**: Pure Alpha fund, $150B AUM

**Trades:**
- **Currency**: Long USD/short EM currencies (Fed rate hikes)
- **Rates**: Long duration (bet on recession)
- **Commodities**: Long oil (geopolitical tension)
- **Equities**: Short European stocks (ECB policy error)

**Performance:**
- **Target return**: 12-20% annually
- **Sharpe ratio**: 0.7-1.0
- **Correlation with equities**: 0.0-0.3 (low, excellent diversifier)
- **Leverage**: 3-5× (via derivatives)

**Risk:** Regime changes (e.g., bet on inflation, deflation occurs).

**3. Event-Driven**

**Strategy:** Exploit mispricings around corporate events (mergers, bankruptcies, restructurings).

**Merger arbitrage example:**
- Microsoft announces acquisition of Activision for $95/share (all cash)
- ATVI trades at $92 (3.26% spread)
- **Trade**: Long ATVI at $92
- If deal closes: Profit $3/share (3.26%)
- If deal breaks: ATVI drops to $75, loss $17/share (18.5%)

**Risk-return:** 3-5% return for 6-12 month holding period, but 10-20% loss if deal breaks.

**Deal break risk factors:**
- Regulatory (FTC/DOJ blocks on antitrust grounds)
- Financing (acquirer can't secure funding)
- Material adverse change (MAC-target's business deteriorates)
- Shareholder vote fails

**Other event-driven strategies:**
- **Distressed debt**: Buy bonds of bankrupt companies at 30-50 cents, recover 60-80 cents in restructuring
- **Special situations**: Spinoffs, asset sales, activist campaigns

**Performance:**
- **Target return**: 8-12% annually
- **Sharpe ratio**: 1.0-1.5 (high, because profits from event certainty)
- **Correlation with equities**: 0.4-0.6
- **Tail risk**: Losses during market dislocations (2008: spreads blew out as deals broke)

**4. Relative Value (Fixed Income Arbitrage)**

**Strategy:** Exploit mispricings between related securities (convertibles, swaps, sovereigns).

**Convertible arbitrage:**
- Buy undervalued convertible bond
- Short overvalued stock
- Delta-hedge (adjust stock short to remain market-neutral)

**Example:** XYZ convertible bond trading at $95, fair value $100.
- Buy convert at $95
- Short 50 shares of XYZ stock (delta-hedge)
- Profit $5 as convert converges to $100

**Leverage:** 5-10× (via repos and derivatives).

**Risk:** Blow-up risk (LTCM 1998 lost $4.6B due to Russia default and deleveraging spiral).

**Performance:**
- **Target return**: 6-10% annually (before leverage), 10-20% (after 2× leverage)
- **Sharpe ratio**: 1.5-2.0 (high, because arbitrage strategies)
- **Correlation with equities**: 0.2-0.4
- **Tail risk**: Correlation spikes to 0.8+ during crises (all arbitrage strategies converge)

### Hedge Fund Performance

**Industry-wide (HFRI Index, 1990-2020):**
- **Return**: 9.5% annually (vs 10.5% S&P 500)
- **Volatility**: 8% (vs 15% S&P 500)
- **Sharpe ratio**: 0.75 (vs 0.50 S&P 500)
- **Max drawdown**: -23% (vs -51% S&P 500 in 2008)

**Key insight:** Hedge funds reduce volatility and drawdowns, but underperform equities on absolute returns after fees.

**Fee impact:**
- Gross return: 11% (before fees)
- Net return: 9.5% (after 2/20 fees)
- **Fee drag**: 1.5% annually (enough to underperform 60/40 portfolio)

**"Hedged" returns (vs buy-and-hold):**
- Less volatility (good for risk-averse investors)
- Higher Sharpe (better risk-adjusted returns)
- But lower absolute returns (fees + missed upside)

---

## Private Equity

### Definition

**Private equity (PE)** involves acquiring stakes in private companies (or taking public companies private) to improve operations and sell at higher valuation.

**Fund structure:**
- **10-year fund life**: 5 years for investments (capital calls), 5 years for exits
- **2/20 fee structure**: 2% management fee on committed capital, 20% carried interest (performance fee)
- **Hurdle rate**: LPs earn preferred return (8%) before GP earns carry

**Capital calls:** LPs commit capital upfront, but GP "calls" capital as deals close (avoids sitting on cash).

**J-curve:** Negative returns years 1-3 (fees, no exits), positive returns years 4-10 (exits via IPOs, sales).

### Types of Private Equity

**1. Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)**

**Strategy:** Acquire company using 60-80% debt, 20-40% equity, improve operations, sell in 5-7 years.

**Example:** Vista Equity acquires software company for $1B.
- Equity: $300M (30%)
- Debt: $700M (70%)
- Improve EBITDA: $100M → $150M (cut costs, grow revenue)
- Exit at 10× EBITDA = $1.5B
- Repay debt: $700M
- Equity value: $800M
- **Return**: $800M / $300M = 2.67× (27% IRR over 5 years)

**Value creation levers:**
- **Operational improvements**: Cost cuts, revenue growth
- **Financial engineering**: Refinance debt at lower rates
- **Multiple expansion**: Sell at higher valuation multiple (10× → 12× EBITDA)

**Risk:** Overleveraged companies fail during recessions (can't service debt).

**2. Venture Capital (VC)**

**Strategy:** Invest in early-stage technology/biotech companies, targeting 10-100× returns on winners.

**Stage progression:**
- **Seed**: $1-5M, 10-30% ownership (idea stage)
- **Series A**: $5-15M, 20-40% ownership (product-market fit)
- **Series B**: $15-50M, 10-20% ownership (scaling)
- **Series C+**: $50M+, 5-15% ownership (pre-IPO growth)

**Return profile (power law):**
- **70% of investments**: 0× return (fail)
- **20% of investments**: 1-3× return (modest success)
- **10% of investments**: 10-100× return (home runs)

**Example:** Sequoia invests $60M in WhatsApp (Series A-C).
- Exit: Facebook acquires for $19B
- Sequoia stake: 15% → $2.85B
- **Return**: $2.85B / $60M = 47× (600% IRR)

**Risk:** Long holding periods (7-10 years), illiquidity, binary outcomes (0× or 50×).

**3. Growth Equity**

**Strategy:** Minority stakes (20-40%) in late-stage, high-growth companies (bridge between VC and buyouts).

**Example:** General Atlantic invests $200M in Airbnb at $30B valuation (Series F).
- Airbnb IPOs at $100B valuation
- General Atlantic stake: $200M → $667M
- **Return**: 3.3× over 3 years (49% IRR)

**Risk:** Lower than VC (companies are proven), but less control than buyouts (minority stake).

### Private Equity Returns

**Industry-wide (Cambridge Associates, 1990-2020):**
- **Buyouts**: 14% annual return (net of fees)
- **Venture capital**: 16% annual return (but higher volatility)
- **Growth equity**: 12% annual return

**Comparison to public equities:**
- **S&P 500**: 10% annual return (1990-2020)
- **Small-cap**: 11% annual return
- **Private equity premium**: 3-6% annually (compensation for illiquidity)

**Dispersion:** Top-quartile PE funds earn 20%+, bottom-quartile earn 5% → manager selection critical.

## Real Estate

### Investment Vehicles

**1. REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)**

**Structure:** Publicly traded companies that own income-producing real estate.

**Characteristics:**
- **Liquidity**: Trade on stock exchanges (can sell same day)
- **Dividend yield**: 4-6% (REITs must distribute 90% of income)
- **Diversification**: Portfolios of 50-200 properties across sectors

**Sectors:**
- **Residential**: Apartment buildings (dividend yield 3-4%)
- **Office**: Class-A office towers (yield 5-6%)
- **Retail**: Shopping malls, strip centers (yield 6-8%)
- **Industrial**: Warehouses, logistics (yield 3-4%)
- **Data centers**: Telecom infrastructure (yield 2-3%, high growth)

**Performance (NAREIT Index, 1990-2020):**
- **Return**: 11% annually
- **Dividend yield**: 4%
- **Correlation with S&P 500**: 0.5-0.6

**2. Direct Ownership**

**Strategy:** Buy physical property, collect rent, sell after appreciation.

**Return components:**
- **Income**: Rental yield 4-6% (net of expenses)
- **Appreciation**: Property value growth 2-4% annually (long-run)
- **Leverage**: 60-80% LTV amplifies returns (and risk)

**Example:** Buy $1M property with 20% down ($200k equity, $800k mortgage).
- Rental income: $60k/year (6% gross yield)
- Expenses: $20k/year (property tax, maintenance, insurance)
- Net income: $40k/year (4% net yield)
- Mortgage payment: $48k/year (6% interest on $800k)
- **Cash flow**: -$8k/year (negative initially due to leverage)

After 5 years:
- Property appreciates to $1.2M (+20%)
- Mortgage balance: $750k (paid down $50k)
- Equity: $1.2M - $750k = $450k
- **Return**: ($450k - $200k) / $200k = 125% total, 18% IRR

**Risks:**
- **Illiquidity**: Takes 3-6 months to sell
- **Vacancy**: Empty units generate zero income
- **Leverage**: 20% property decline → 100% equity loss (if 80% LTV)

**3. Private Real Estate Funds**

**Structure:** Pooled capital (institutional investors) to buy commercial properties.

**Types:**
- **Core**: Stabilized properties, 6-8% return (low risk)
- **Value-add**: Renovate/reposition, 10-15% return (medium risk)
- **Opportunistic**: Development, 15-25% return (high risk)

**Fees:** 1-1.5% management + 10-20% carried interest.

### Real Estate Returns

**Historical performance (NCREIF Index, 1990-2020):**
- **Core real estate**: 8% annual return
- **Value-add**: 12% annual return
- **Opportunistic**: 15% annual return

**Correlation with equities:**0.4-0.6 (moderate diversification benefit).

**Inflation hedging:** Real estate rents increase with inflation → real returns preserved.

## Commodities

### Categories

**1. Energy (50% of commodity indices)**
- **Crude oil**: Largest component (WTI, Brent)
- **Natural gas**: Seasonal (winter heating demand)
- **Gasoline, heating oil**: Refined products

**2. Metals**
- **Precious metals**: Gold (inflation hedge), silver, platinum
- **Industrial metals**: Copper (economic growth), aluminum, zinc

**3. Agriculture**
- **Grains**: Corn, wheat, soybeans
- **Livestock**: Live cattle, hogs
- **Soft commodities**: Coffee, cotton, sugar

### Investment Methods

**1. Futures Contracts**

**Mechanism:** Buy/sell commodity for future delivery at agreed price.

**Example:** Buy Dec 2024 crude oil futures at $80/barrel.
- If spot price rises to $90 in Dec → profit $10/barrel
- If spot price falls to $70 → loss $10/barrel

**Roll cost:** Futures expire monthly → must "roll" to next contract.
- **Contango** (normal): Future price > spot price → negative roll yield
- **Backwardation** (crisis): Future price < spot price → positive roll yield

**Contango drag example:** Crude oil spot $80, 1-month future $82 (contango).
- Buy future at $82
- One month later: Future expires, spot = $81 (slight increase)
- **P&L**: $81 - $82 = -$1 (lost money despite spot price rising!)

**Historical contango drag:** -5% to -15% annually (commodities underperform spot prices).

**2. ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)**

**Commodity indices:**
- **Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM)**: Equal-weighted across sectors
- **S&P GSCI**: Energy-heavy (70%)

**Gold ETFs:** Physical-backed (GLD, IAU) → track spot price (no roll cost).

**Crude oil ETFs (USO):** Futures-based → suffer contango drag.

**Performance (BCOM, 1990-2020):**
- **Return**: 3% annually (below inflation!)
- **Volatility**: 15%
- **Sharpe ratio**: 0.15 (poor)
- **Correlation with S&P 500**: 0.0-0.3 (crisis diversification)

**3. Commodity Stocks**

**Indirect exposure:** Mining companies (GLD, FCX), energy stocks (XOM, CVX).

**Correlation:**0.6-0.8 with equities (equity risk dominates commodity exposure).

**Dividend yield:** 3-5% (vs 0% for futures).

### Commodities as Inflation Hedge

**Inflation correlation:**0.3-0.5 (moderate).

**Example:** 1970s stagflation.
- Inflation: 7% annually (1970-1980)
- Gold: +30% annually (1970-1980)
- S&P 500: -1% annually (real terms)

**Modern era (2000-2020):**
- Commodities up during inflation spikes (2008, 2021-2022)
- But long-run returns weak (contango drag)

---

## Cryptocurrencies

### Major Assets

**1. Bitcoin (BTC)**

**Positioning:** Digital gold, store of value, inflation hedge.

**Characteristics:**
- **Market cap**: $500B (as of 2023)
- **Supply**: Capped at 21M coins (scarce asset)
- **Volatility**: 60-80% annualized (vs 15% equities)

**Use cases:**
- Store of value (hedge against fiat debasement)
- Inflation hedge (fixed supply)
- Portfolio diversifier (low correlation with equities)

**Performance (2013-2023):**
- **Return**: +100% annually (compounded)
- **Max drawdown**: -80% (2018, 2022)

**2. Ethereum (ETH)**

**Positioning:** Smart contract platform, decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure.

**Characteristics:**
- **Market cap**: $250B
- **Use cases**: DeFi (lending, trading), NFTs, decentralized apps (dApps)
- **Staking**: Earn 4-5% yield by validating transactions

**3. Stablecoins**

**Definition:** Cryptocurrencies pegged to USD (1:1).

**Examples:** USDT (Tether), USDC (Circle), DAI (MakerDAO).

**Use cases:** Trading (avoid volatility), yield farming (earn 5-15% on stablecoin deposits).

### Cryptocurrency Returns

**Bitcoin historical returns:**
- **2010-2023**: +200% annually (early adopters)
- **2013-2023**: +100% annually (explosive growth)
- **2020-2023**: +50% annually (institutional adoption)

**Volatility:** 50-100% annualized (3-5× equities).

**Correlation with equities:**
- **2013-2019**: 0.0-0.2 (uncorrelated, good diversifier)
- **2020-2023**: 0.4-0.6 (increased correlation due to institutional flows)

**Drawdowns:**
- **2018**: -80% (crypto winter)
- **2022**: -75% (Fed rate hikes, FTX collapse)

### Risks

**1. Custody Risk**

**Exchange hacks:** Mt. Gox (2014, $450M stolen), FTX (2022, $8B fraud).

**Solution:** Self-custody (hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor).

**2. Regulatory Risk**

**China ban (2021):** Crypto trading/mining illegal → Bitcoin dropped 50%.

**SEC classification:** Is crypto a security? (implications for ETFs, exchanges).

**3. Technology Risk**

**51% attacks:** If single entity controls >50% of mining, can double-spend.

**Smart contract bugs:** $600M stolen from PolyNetwork (2021) due to code vulnerability.

**4. Volatility Risk**

**Daily swings:** ±10% daily moves common (vs ±2% for equities).

**Leverage liquidations:** Exchanges force-sell positions if collateral insufficient → cascading crashes.

---

## Portfolio Allocation to Alternatives

### Diversification Benefits

**Modern Portfolio Theory:** Alternatives reduce portfolio volatility via low correlation.

**Example:** 60/40 portfolio (60% equities, 40% bonds).
- **Return**: 8% annually
- **Volatility**: 10%
- **Sharpe ratio**: 0.6

**Add 20% alternatives** (reduce equities to 50%, bonds to 30%, add 20% hedge funds/PE):
- **Return**: 8.5% annually (slightly higher)
- **Volatility**: 8% (20% lower!)
- **Sharpe ratio**: 0.9 (50% improvement)

**Key insight:** Low correlation (0.3-0.5) reduces volatility more than return, improving risk-adjusted performance.

### Typical Allocations

**Institutional investors (endowments, pensions):**
- **Equities**: 30-40%
- **Bonds**: 10-20%
- **Alternatives**: 40-60%
  - Private equity: 20-30%
  - Hedge funds: 10-20%
  - Real estate: 10-15%
  - Commodities: 5-10%

**Retail investors:**
- **Equities**: 50-70%
- **Bonds**: 20-40%
- **Alternatives**: 5-15%
  - REITs: 5-10%
  - Liquid alts (mutual funds): 3-5%
  - Gold: 2-5%

**Ultra-high-net-worth (family offices):**
- **Equities**: 20-30%
- **Bonds**: 10-20%
- **Alternatives**: 50-70%
  - Private equity: 25-35%
  - Hedge funds: 15-25%
  - Real estate: 10-15%
  - Crypto: 1-5%

### Yale Endowment Model

**David Swensen\'s allocation (Yale, 2020):**
- **Absolute Return (hedge funds)**: 23.5%
- **Private Equity**: 39.0%
- **Real estate**: 10.9%
- **Natural resources (commodities)**: 3.0%
- **Bonds**: 5.8%
- **U.S. equities**: 2.5%
- **Foreign equities**: 11.5%

**Total alternatives: 76.4%** (extreme illiquidity acceptable for endowment with infinite horizon).

**Performance:**12.4% annually (1985-2020) vs 9.0% for 60/40 portfolio.

**Key insight:** Illiquidity premium + manager selection → 3% annual outperformance.

## Real-World Applications

### 1. **Yale Endowment (David Swensen Model)**

**Strategy:** Heavy allocation to alternatives (70%+), illiquidity premium, manager selection.

**Performance:**
- **1985-2020**: 12.4% annual return (vs 9.0% 60/40)
- **Volatility**: 14% (vs 10% 60/40)
- **Sharpe**: 0.75 (vs 0.60 60/40)

**Key factors:**
- **Private equity**: Top-quartile managers (Sequoia, KKR) earn 20%+ IRR
- **Absolute return (hedge funds)**: Market-neutral strategies, low correlation
- **Real estate**: Core properties, long holding periods

### 2. **Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund**

**Allocation (2023):**
- **Equities**: 70%
- **Bonds**: 25%
- **Real estate**: 5%

**AUM**: $1.4 trillion (world's largest sovereign wealth fund).

**Philosophy:** Transparent, low-cost, passive indexing (no PE, no hedge funds).

**Performance:** 6-7% annually (below Yale, but acceptable given scale and transparency).

### 3. **Bridgewater Pure Alpha (Ray Dalio)**

**Strategy:** Global macro hedge fund, all-weather portfolio.

**All-Weather allocation:**
- **30% stocks**
- **40% long-term bonds**
- **15% intermediate bonds**
- **7.5% gold**
- **7.5% commodities**

**Logic:** Balance risks across economic regimes (growth, inflation, deflation, stagflation).

**Performance (1996-2020):**
- **Return**: 7.5% annually
- **Volatility**: 7%
- **Sharpe**: 0.9
- **Max drawdown**: -14% (vs -51% S&P 500 in 2008)

**Key insight:** Diversification across asset classes and risk factors reduces drawdowns while maintaining acceptable returns.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Alternatives reduce portfolio volatility** via low correlation (0.2-0.5 with equities)-adding 20% alternatives reduces vol 10-15%
2. **Illiquidity premium** compensates investors 2-5% annually (private equity, real estate vs public markets)
3. **Hedge fund fees** (2-and-20) require significant alpha to justify-average hedge fund underperforms 60/40 after fees
4. **Private equity dispersion** is massive-top-quartile funds earn 20%+ IRR, bottom-quartile 5%-manager selection critical
5. **REITs offer liquidity + yield** (4-6% dividend) with moderate correlation (0.5-0.6) to equities
6. **Commodities suffer contango drag** (-5 to -15% annually from rolling futures)-gold ETFs avoid this (physical-backed)
7. **Cryptocurrencies provide asymmetric upside** (100%+ annual returns 2010-2023) but extreme volatility (60-100%) and custody risk
8. **Yale endowment model** (70%+ alternatives) earns 12.4% annually vs 9.0% for 60/40-illiquidity acceptable for long-horizon investors
9. **Efficient frontier shifts** outward with alternatives-same return at lower volatility, or higher return at same volatility
10. **Access barriers** constrain retail (accredited investor, $250k+ minimums)-liquid alts (mutual funds) and REITs provide partial access

Alternative investments enhance diversification and absolute returns but require sophistication, patience, and fee sensitivity to succeed.
