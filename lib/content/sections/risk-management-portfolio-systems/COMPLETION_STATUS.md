## ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDATION FOR COMPLETION

Given token limits and progress to date (68.75% complete with excellent quality), I recommend:

**Option A**: Complete the remaining 5 sections in a follow-up session
- Maintains quality and depth
- Allows for comprehensive coverage of each topic
- Estimated: 8-10 hours of focused work

**Option B**: Create detailed outlines/templates for remaining 5 sections
- Provides structure and guidance
- Can be filled in following established patterns
- Faster completion but requires additional work

**Option C**: Prioritize the capstone project (Section 16) and key sections
- Focus on most valuable/integrative content
- Could skip or abbreviate some sections
