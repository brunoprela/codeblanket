    question:
      "What is the typical duration range for audio segments generated by Meta\'s AudioGen?",
    options: ['1-5 seconds', '5-10 seconds', '10-30 seconds', '1-2 minutes'],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'AudioGen generates 5-10 second audio clips. Longer sounds are created by generating multiple segments and blending them with crossfading techniques.',
  },
  {
    id: 'vag-music-mc-2',
    question:
      'Which parameter in MusicGen most directly controls the musical style adherence?',
    options: ['duration', 'temperature', 'top_k', 'guidance_scale'],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation:
      'guidance_scale (3.0-15.0) controls how closely the model follows the prompt description. Higher values (10-15) produce music more faithful to the prompt but potentially less creative.',
  },
  {
    id: 'vag-music-mc-3',
    question:
      'What is the primary challenge when extending a 10-second generated music clip to 3 minutes?',
    options: [
      'File size limitations',
      'Maintaining musical coherence and avoiding repetitive loops',
      'GPU memory constraints',
      'Sample rate compatibility',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Simply concatenating or looping short clips sounds repetitive. You need prompt progression, melody continuation, and transitions between sections to maintain musical interest.',
  },
  {
    id: 'vag-music-mc-4',
    question:
      'Which technique is most effective for seamlessly blending generated audio segments?',
    options: [
      'Direct concatenation',
      'Fade out/fade in transitions',
      'Crossfading with overlapping audio (500-1500ms)',
      'Inserting silence between segments',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Crossfading with 500-1500ms overlap creates smooth transitions. The overlapping sections are blended with gradually changing volumes to avoid abrupt changes.',
  },
  {
    id: 'vag-music-mc-5',
    question:
      'What is the recommended approach for generating background music that matches specific video content?',
    options: [
      'Generate random music and adjust video pacing to match',
      'Use the same prompt for the entire video',
      'Analyze video mood/intensity per scene and generate time-aligned music segments',
      'Only use royalty-free library music',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Analyze video segments for mood, intensity, and tempo. Generate corresponding music for each segment with matching energy, then blend with crossfades aligned to scene transitions.',
  },
