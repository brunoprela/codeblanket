        question:
            'An up-and-out call option has a spot price of $100, strike of $100, and barrier at $120. What happens if the stock reaches $121 during the option\'s life?',
        options: [
            'Option is knocked out and becomes worthless',
            'Option pays out immediately',
            'Option continues but strike adjusts to $121',
            'Option converts to a put',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Up-and-out option knocked out (worthless) when barrier hit. Mechanism: Barrier: $120 (above current spot $100). Monitoring: Continuous (any time) or discrete (daily closes). Stock reaches $121: Crosses barrier ($121 > $120). Result: Option immediately knocked out, ceases to exist. Payoff: $0, regardless of final stock price at expiry. Example timeline: Day 1: Stock $100, option alive (value ~$5). Day 30: Stock rises to $121, barrier hit. Option knocked out: Value drops to $0 instantly. Day 60 (expiry): Stock $130 (deeply ITM), but option already dead. Final payoff: $0 (not $30 like vanilla call would pay). Why knocked out: "Out" in up-and-out means option dies when barrier hit. Opposite of "in" (which activates). Purpose: Cheaper premium than vanilla (reduced payoff probability). Investor bets: Stock rises but stays below $120. Cost savings: Up-and-out might cost $3 vs vanilla $5 (40% discount). Risk: If wrong about cap, lose everything. Barrier types: Up-and-out: Dies if rises above barrier (call typically). Down-and-out: Dies if falls below barrier (put typically). Up-and-in: Activates only if rises above (dormant until hit). Down-and-in: Activates only if falls below. Why not "pays out immediately"? That would be touch option (one-touch). Pays fixed amount immediately upon touching barrier. Different product: Digital/binary feature. Barrier options: Continue until expiry (if alive) or knocked out (if barrier hit). Payoff at expiry only (like vanilla), not immediately. Why not "strike adjusts"? Strike is fixed at inception ($100 in this case). Barrier hitting doesn\'t change terms, just kills option. No strike adjustment mechanism in standard barrier options. Would be custom exotic if it did (very rare). Why not "converts to put"? No conversion feature in barrier options. Stays call (or put, whatever type it is). Knock-out: Simply terminates, doesn\'t transform. Conversion: Different product class (convertible options, rare). Practical example: Investor outlook: "Stock will rise to $115 but not above $120". Strategy: Buy up-and-out call with barrier $120. Cost: $3 (vs $5 vanilla). Outcome if right (stock $115 at expiry): Payoff: $115 - $100 = $15. Return: ($15 - $3) / $3 = 400% gain. Outcome if wrong (stock $125, barrier hit): Knock-out: Even though ended at $125 ITM. Payoff: $0. Loss: -100% (lost $3 premium). Risk management: Barrier breached: Immediate risk, no hedging opportunity. Traders: Monitor closely, may buy vanilla call as backup if approaching barrier. Rebate options: Some barriers pay small rebate if knocked out (e.g., $0.50). Softens blow, but still lose most of premium.',

        question:
            'Why are Asian options typically cheaper than vanilla options with the same strike and maturity?',
        options: [
            'Based on average price which has lower volatility than final price',
            'They have worse liquidity',
            'They are only available for commodities',
            'They require more complex pricing models',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Asian options cheaper because average price has lower volatility. Volatility comparison: Spot price volatility: Daily moves can be large (±5% days). Single final price: Entire payoff depends on one random variable. High volatility: Greater uncertainty → higher option value. Average price volatility: Average smooths out daily fluctuations. Law of large numbers: Average of 252 daily prices less volatile than any single price. Reduced volatility: Less uncertainty → lower option value. Mathematical: Vanilla option: Payoff = max(S(T) - K, 0), depends on S(T) only. Asian option: Payoff = max(Avg_price - K, 0), depends on average. Average volatility: σ_avg ≈ σ_spot / √n, where n = number of observations. Example: σ_spot = 25% (annual). n = 252 days. σ_avg ≈ 25% / √252 ≈ 1.6% (much lower!). Option value: Proportional to volatility (vega > 0). Lower vol → lower value. Example pricing: Vanilla call: Strike $100, 1-year, σ=25%, price ≈ $10. Asian call: Same strike/maturity, σ_eff ≈ 15% (averaged), price ≈ $6. Discount: 40% cheaper. Practical savings: 30-50% cost reduction typical. Applications: Hedging commodities: Oil companies hedge monthly average price (not spot). Asian options: Match actual revenue (monthly average). Cost-effective: Save on premium while hedging effectively. FX hedging: Companies with regular payments. Average exchange rate: Better match to actual costs. Manipulation resistance: Average harder to manipulate than single fixing. Single fixing: Trader can push price on expiry date. Average: Would need to manipulate every day (much harder, costlier). Why not "worse liquidity"? Liquidity: Factor in bid-ask spread, not option premium itself. Asian options: Reasonably liquid in commodity/FX markets. Vanilla: More liquid, but doesn\'t explain structural price difference. The fundamental driver is volatility reduction, not liquidity. Why not "only for commodities"? Asian options: Available for stocks, commodities, FX, indices. Not restricted to commodities. Commodities: Common use case (oil, gold), but not exclusive. Equities: Less common but possible (average share price over quarter). Why not "complex pricing"? Complexity: Makes them slightly MORE expensive (modeling costs). But effect is tiny (few bp) vs structural volatility reduction (30-50%). Market makers: Charge slightly more for complex products. But buyer still saves money overall (volatility effect dominates). Arithmetic vs geometric: Arithmetic average: (S1 + S2 + ... + Sn) / n, standard, no closed form. Geometric average: (S1 × S2 × ... × Sn)^(1/n), has closed-form formula. Geometric: Slightly cheaper than arithmetic (geometric < arithmetic average). Both: Cheaper than vanilla due to volatility reduction. Trade-offs: Asian: Cheaper, lower payoff potential. Vanilla: Expensive, full upside capture. Choice: Depends on hedging needs vs budget.',

        question:
            'A principal protected note invests $1,000 with $950 in a zero-coupon bond and $50 in call options. What is the primary purpose of this structure?',
        options: [
            'Guarantee return of principal while providing upside participation',
            'Maximize returns regardless of risk',
            'Provide fixed income only',
            'Hedge against inflation',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Principal protected note guarantees principal return + upside participation. Structure breakdown: Investment: $1,000 total. Component 1 - Zero-coupon bond: Amount: $950. Maturity: 5 years (matches note maturity). Yield: ~1% (grows $950 → $1,000). Purpose: Guarantee principal repayment. Component 2 - Call options: Amount: $50. Strike: ATM or slightly OTM. Participation: E.g., 50% of stock gains. Purpose: Provide upside exposure. Guaranteed outcome: Minimum: $1,000 (bond matures at par). Maximum: $1,000 + option payoff (unlimited theoretically). Investor protected: Cannot lose principal (assuming issuer doesn\'t default). Example payoffs: Scenario 1 - Stock flat: Bond: $1,000. Options: $0 (ATM, no gain). Total: $1,000 (100% capital protection). Return: 0% (but no loss!). Scenario 2 - Stock up 40%: Bond: $1,000. Options: $50 → $70 (40% gain with leverage). Total: $1,070. Return: 7% (captured some upside). Scenario 3 - Stock down 30%: Bond: $1,000. Options: $0 (expire worthless). Total: $1,000. Return: 0% (protected from -30% loss). Value proposition: Downside: Protected (can\'t lose principal). Upside: Participates (though not 100%, depends on participation rate). Trade-off: Give up some upside for downside protection. Target investors: Risk-averse: Want market exposure but fear losses. Retirees: Need capital preservation but want growth. Conservative: "I want to be in stocks but can\'t afford to lose principal". Participation rate: Full participation example: Stock up 20% → Note up 20% (requires more expensive options). Partial participation: Stock up 20% → Note up 10% (50% participation). Note: Trade-off between protection level and participation. Why not "maximize returns"? Maximum returns: Achieved by investing all $1,000 in stock/options. PPN: Sacrifices return potential for protection. Stock $1,000 → $1,400 (40% gain): PPN $1,070 (7% gain). Gave up $330 upside for protection. Not maximizing, optimizing risk/return. Why not "fixed income only"? Fixed income: Predictable coupon payments, no upside. PPN: Includes equity options (upside potential). More than fixed income: Hybrid structure. Fixed income alone: Can\'t participate in market gains. Why not "hedge against inflation"? Inflation hedging: Requires real assets (TIPS, commodities, real estate). PPN: Nominal principal protection ($1,000 nominal). Inflation: $1,000 in 5 years buys less (real value declines). Not specifically designed for inflation. Could use TIPS instead of nominal bond, but not standard. Risks to note: Issuer default: If bank/issuer defaults, lose everything (Lehman 2008). PPN: Unsecured debt, not guaranteed by government. Credit risk: Significant (mitigated by choosing strong issuer). Opportunity cost: Could have earned more in stocks if market rises strongly. Forgo some gains for protection. Liquidity: Usually hold to maturity (no secondary market). Fees: Embedded in structure (lower participation rate). Variations: Capital guaranteed: 100% protection. Capital protected: May be 95% protection (small loss possible). Partial participation: 50-80% of gains. Enhanced participation: >100% in narrow range (but capped).',

        question:
            'What is the main risk of a reverse convertible note that pays high coupons but may convert to stock?',
        options: [
            'May be forced to accept stock worth less than principal if price falls',
            'Coupons may not be paid',
            'Cannot be sold before maturity',
            'Interest rate risk only',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Reverse convertible: Forced to accept depreciated stock if price falls below barrier. Structure: Investment: $1,000. Coupon: 10% annually (very high vs 3% normal bonds). Conversion trigger: If stock < $80 at maturity. Payoff at maturity: Stock ≥ $80: Receive $1,000 cash + coupons. Stock < $80: Forced to take stock (e.g., 12.5 shares at $80 = $1,000 notional). Risk scenario: Issue: Stock $100, barrier $80 (80% of initial). Year 1: Receive $100 coupon (10%). Year 2: Receive $100 coupon. Year 3 maturity: Stock $60 (fell 40%). Conversion: Receive 12.5 shares × $60 = $750 (not $1,000 cash). Total return: +$300 coupons -$250 principal loss = +$50. Looks okay: But $50 gain vs $1,000 risk = only 5% over 3 years = 1.6% annually. Horrible: Stock fell 40%, you lost 25% after coupons. Better to have: Just held stock (down 40% but could recover). Bonds: Safe principal, lower coupon. Why investors misunderstand: Attracted by: 10% coupon (vs 3% bonds). Think: "Stock unlikely to fall 20%". Reality: Stock can fall much further (40-50% in bear markets). Conversion: Forced to take depreciated stock. No choice: Can\'t demand cash. Component breakdown: Long bond: Fixed 10% coupon, $1,000 principal. Short put option: Sold put at $80 strike. If stock < $80: Must buy at $80 (forced conversion). Put premium: ~$120 (pays for extra 7% coupon over 3 years). Economics: Investor: Earning 10% but sold put (takes downside risk). Issuer: Pays high coupon but owns cheap put (transfers risk to investor). Net: Investor compensated for risk, but often underestimates probability. Historical examples: 2008 financial crisis: Many reverse convertibles on bank stocks. Banks fell 60-80% (below barriers). Investors: Received high coupons for 1-2 years. Then: Forced conversion to worthless stock. Result: Lost 50-70% of principal despite coupons. 2020 COVID: Oil reverse convertibles. Oil companies fell 70%+. Conversions: Forced to take energy stock at $50, now worth $15. Lawsuits: Investors claimed products missold (didn\'t understand risk). Why not "coupons may not be paid"? Coupons: Usually guaranteed (fixed obligation). Issuer: Must pay coupons regardless of stock price. Default: Only if issuer defaults (credit event), not stock price. Reverse convertible: Coupon payment is the CERTAINTY. Stock conversion is the RISK (not coupon non-payment). Why not "cannot be sold"? Liquidity: True, usually hold to maturity. But: Not the MAIN risk. Main risk: Principal loss from forced conversion. Liquidity: Secondary consideration. Investor could be forced to hold depreciating stock even if liquid. Why not "interest rate risk only"? Interest rates: Affect bond pricing. But: Not main driver of reverse convertible risk. Main risk: Equity price falling (conversion risk). Interest rates: Minor factor (affects coupon value). Stock price: Dominant risk (determines conversion). Suitability: Appropriate for: Bullish or neutral on stock (believe won\'t fall). Want income, accept downside risk. Understand risk (sophisticated). Inappropriate for: Risk-averse (principal protection needed). Don\'t understand stock risk (misselling). Need liquidity. Marketing: Often sold as "high yield bonds". Misleading: Not bonds, equity derivatives with huge risk. Regulators: Increased scrutiny post-2008 (many investor losses).',

        question:
            'A lookback call option allows the holder to buy at the minimum price observed during the option\'s life. Why are these options expensive?',
        options: [
            'Always optimal to exercise (no time decay risk), captures best possible entry',
            'They are only available for high volatility stocks',
            'Require constant monitoring',
            'Can only be exercised once',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Lookback options expensive because always optimal (no time decay), best possible outcome. Mechanism: Lookback call (floating strike): Payoff: S(T) - min(S over life). Buy at lowest price seen, sell at final price. Always profitable if stock rises at all. Lookback put (floating strike): Payoff: max(S over life) - S(T). Sell at highest price seen, buy at final price. Always profitable if stock falls at all. Example: Stock path: Starts $100, drops to $80 (minimum), recovers to $110 (final). Vanilla call ($100 strike): Payoff: $110 - $100 = $10. Lookback call: Payoff: $110 - $80 = $30 (3× better!). Always hindsight optimal: Captures best possible entry/exit. Why expensive: No time decay risk: Vanilla option: Might expire worthless (OTM). Time decay: Option loses value approaching expiry if ATM/OTM. Risk: Could lose entire premium. Lookback: Always captures best level seen. Can\'t expire worthless: If stock moves at all, positive payoff. No time decay: Value can\'t decay to zero. Maximum information: Uses ALL prices over life (not just final). More info: Better outcome → higher value. Vanilla: One data point (final price). Lookback: 252 data points (daily prices). Pricing: Lookback: 2-3× price of vanilla ATM option. Example: Vanilla: $10. Lookback: $25. Premium: 150% more. Mathematical: Lookback European call: C = S × N(a1) - S × (σ²/2r) × N(-a1) - m × e^(-rT) × N(-a2). where m = minimum price seen so far. Complex: Closed form exists but complicated (versus simple Black-Scholes). Applications: When used: Post-trade: "I wish I'd bought at the low". Lookback: Effectively does that. Performance fees: "High - water mark" similar concept. Rare: Due to high cost, limited usage. Alternatives: Asian options: Average price, cheaper. Partial lookback: Look at minimum over subset of dates (cheaper). Vanilla: Just accept you can\'t time perfectly. Why not "only for high volatility stocks"? Availability: Lookback options available for any underlying. Volatility: Affects price (higher vol → higher price), but doesn\'t restrict availability. High vol stocks: Make lookbacks even more expensive (more movement = bigger min-max range). Not a restriction: Can trade on low vol stocks (just less common due to cost). Why not "require constant monitoring"? Monitoring: Automatic by exchange/clearinghouse. Investor: Doesn\'t need to watch constantly. Payoff: Automatically determined at expiry (minimum found by system). Not a cost: No manual effort required. Expense: Comes from payoff structure, not operational complexity. Why not "can only be exercised once"? Exercise: True, but same as vanilla options (one exercise). Not a distinguishing factor: All options one-time exercise (except Bermudans). Doesn\'t explain higher cost: Lookback expensive due to better payoff, not exercise restrictions. Comparison: Barrier options: Cheaper than vanilla (worse outcome possible). Asian options: Cheaper (average reduces volatility). Lookback options: Much more expensive (best possible outcome). Digital options: Usually cheaper (fixed payoff). Cost hierarchy: Lookback > Vanilla > Asian > Barrier (generally). Real-world usage: Rare in practice: Too expensive for most investors. Academic interest: Theoretical pricing, hedging challenges. Some structured products: Embedded lookback features (partial). Hedge funds: Occasionally use for specific strategies. Mark-to-market: High gamma: Delta changes dramatically. Hard to hedge: Requires constant rebalancing. Model risk: Sensitive to volatility assumptions.',
