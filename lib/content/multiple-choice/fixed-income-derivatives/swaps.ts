        question:
            'A company enters a 5-year interest rate swap to pay 4.5% fixed and receive SOFR on $100 million notional. If SOFR is currently 5.0%, what is the net semi-annual payment?',
        options: [
            'Company receives $250,000',
            'Company pays $250,000',
            'Company receives $500,000',
            'No payment (notional not exchanged)',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Company receives net $250,000 (floating > fixed). Calculation: Notional: $100,000,000. Fixed rate: 4.5% annual, paid semi-annually. Floating rate (SOFR): 5.0% annual. Semi-annual fixed payment: 4.5% × $100M / 2 = $2,250,000 (company PAYS). Semi-annual floating payment: 5.0% × $100M / 2 = $2,500,000 (company RECEIVES). Net settlement: $2,500,000 - $2,250,000 = $250,000 received by company. Direction: Floating > Fixed → receive-floating party (company) receives net payment. Why company receives: Company pays fixed 4.5%, receives SOFR 5.0%. When SOFR > Fixed rate: Net inflow (good for company). When SOFR < Fixed rate: Net outflow (company pays difference). Swap mechanics: Only NET payment exchanged (not gross). If floating > fixed: Fixed payer receives difference. If fixed > floating: Fixed payer pays difference. Notional: NOT exchanged in interest rate swaps (only interest payments). Would be exchanged in currency swaps. Why not "$250,000 paid"? That would be if SOFR < fixed (e.g., SOFR 4.0%). Fixed payment $2.25M, floating $2.0M, pay $250K. But question states SOFR = 5.0% > 4.5%, so RECEIVE. Why not "$500,000 received"? That would be if no dividing by 2 (annual not semi-annual). Annual net: (5.0% - 4.5%) × $100M = $500K. But payments are semi-annual: $500K / 2 = $250K per period. Or: Each rate halved: (2.5% - 2.25%) × $100M = $250K. Why not "no payment"? Notional is reference for calculating payments. Interest payments ARE exchanged (net basis). Only in currency swaps are notional amounts also exchanged. Economic interpretation: Company effectively converted floating-rate debt to fixed-rate. Original debt: SOFR + spread (say 2%) = 5.0% + 2.0% = 7.0% floating. Swap: Pay 4.5% fixed, receive SOFR 5.0%. Net: 4.5% + 2.0% = 6.5% fixed (hedged floating exposure). When SOFR rises to 5.5%: Debt cost: 5.5% + 2.0% = 7.5%. Swap inflow: (5.5% - 4.5%) × $100M / 2 = $500K per period. Net cost still: 7.5% - 1.0% = 6.5% fixed (swap works as hedge). Present value perspective: Swap value to company (pay-fixed): PV = PV(floating leg) - PV(fixed leg). At inception: PV = 0 (fair swap rate 4.5% set so NPV = 0). Later: If rates rise (SOFR curve shifts up), PV(floating) increases, PV(fixed) unchanged, Swap gains value (positive MTM). If rates fall, swap loses value (negative MTM). Current payment: Just realized cash flow (piece of total swap value), reflects current SOFR vs fixed rate difference.',

        question:
            'In a currency swap, how is it different from an interest rate swap regarding notional amounts?',
        options: [
            'Notional amounts are exchanged at both inception and maturity',
            'Notional amounts are never exchanged',
            'Notional amounts are only exchanged at maturity',
            'Notional amounts are only exchanged if one party defaults',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Currency swaps exchange notional at inception AND maturity. Structure: Inception (Day 1): Party A pays $110 million. Party B pays €100 million. Actual exchange of principal (not just reference). During swap lifetime: A pays EUR interest on €100M (e.g., 3.5% annually). B pays USD interest on $110M (e.g., 5.0% annually). Periodic interest payments exchanged. Maturity (Final day): Reverse notional exchange: A receives back $110 million. B receives back €100 million. Why notional exchange necessary: Purpose: Provide each party actual currency they need. Example: US company needs €100M for European operations. EU company needs $110M for US operations. Swap provides each the currency at agreed rate (1.10 USD/EUR). Both avoid FX transaction costs at spot + future uncertainty. Actual need: Parties actually USE the exchanged notional (not just reference). US company invests €100M in Europe, earns EUR returns. Pays back €100M at maturity from those EUR cash flows. Risk implications: FX exposure: Swap exposed to FX rate changes throughout life. If USD/EUR moves from 1.10 to 1.20: $110M / €100M ratio no longer matches market. One party gains, other loses (mark-to-market). Interest rate exposure: Both currencies\' rate curves affect value. Credit risk: Both notional and interest payments at risk if counterparty defaults. Much larger exposure than IRS (where only net interest at risk). Why not "never exchanged"? That\'s interest rate swaps (same currency). Only interest payments exchanged, notional is reference. Currency swaps MUST exchange to provide actual currency. Why not "only at maturity"? Would leave parties without currency at inception. Defeats purpose (need currency now for operations, not later). Also: Initial exchange establishes FX rate for final exchange (locked in). Why not "only if default"? Default: Swap terminates, no maturity exchange occurs. Surviving party loses expected notional return (counterparty risk). Normal operation: Both exchanges happen (inception + maturity). Comparison to IRS: Interest Rate Swap (same currency, e.g., USD): Notional: $100M (reference only, not exchanged). Payments: Net interest only (fixed vs floating). Exposure: Net interest differential (~1-2% of notional). Currency Swap (different currencies, e.g., USD/EUR): Notional: $110M and €100M (EXCHANGED both times). Payments: Gross interest (sometimes netted if same dates). Exposure: Full notional + interest (100% of notional at risk). Real-world example (2008): Lehman Brothers currency swaps: Counterparties expecting final notional return. Lehman defaults: Unable to return notional at maturity. Losses: ~100% of notional (huge exposure). Many companies learned: Currency swap counterparty risk >> IRS risk. Post-crisis: More clearing, collateralization for currency swaps. Accounting treatment: Inception: Record as asset (foreign currency received) + liability (future return obligation). Balance sheet: Both sides show (unlike IRS where just off-balance sheet). Maturity: Reverse booking, swap settles.',

        question:
            'At inception, what is the theoretical value of a fairly priced interest rate swap?',
        options: ['Zero', 'Positive (favors fixed payer)', 'Negative (favors floating payer)', 'Equal to the notional amount'],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Fairly priced swap has value = zero at inception. Swap pricing principle: Fixed rate (swap rate) set such that: PV(Fixed leg) = PV(Floating leg). NPV = PV(Floating) - PV(Fixed) = 0. Fair swap rate: Neither party pays premium to enter. Both parties have equal value (zero NPV). Mechanism: Fixed leg PV: Σ(Fixed_rate × Notional × DCF_i × DF_i) + Notional × DF_final. Wait, simplified: Σ(Fixed_pmt_i × DF_i). Floating leg PV: At each reset, floating leg worth par. PV = Notional × (1 - DF_final). Set equal: Fixed_rate × Σ(DCF_i × DF_i) = (1 - DF_final). Solve: Swap_rate = (1 - DF_final) / Σ(DCF_i × DF_i). This rate makes NPV = 0. Example: 5-year swap, discount factors: DF_0.5 = 0.975, DF_1.0 = 0.951, ..., DF_5.0 = 0.780. Sum of DFs (semi-annual): 4.25 (simplified). Swap rate: (1 - 0.780) / 4.25 = 0.220 / 4.25 = 5.18%. At this 5.18% rate: PV(fixed payments at 5.18%) = PV(floating payments). NPV = 0. Why zero at inception: Market equilibrium: If swap had positive value: Everyone would want to be receiver (get free value). Demand drives swap rate down until NPV = 0. If negative value: Everyone wants to be payer. Rate rises until NPV = 0. Competitive market: Many dealers quote swaps. Rates converge to fair value (zero NPV). No-arbitrage: If swap NPV ≠ 0: Arbitrage opportunity (combined with bonds). Forces convergence to zero. After inception: Swap value changes: Rates move → discountfactors change → PV legs change → NPV ≠ 0. Example: Rates rise 1% (curves shift up): PV(floating leg) increases (future floating payments higher). PV(fixed leg) decreases (discount rates higher). Pay-fixed swap: NPV rises (positive value). Receive-fixed swap: NPV falls (negative value). Mark-to-market: Daily revaluation → swap value fluctuates. Can be large ($millions on $100M notional). Why not "positive favors fixed payer"? At inception, fairly priced = zero (neither party favored). After inception: Can be positive or negative depending on rate moves. Positive to fixed payer: Only if rates rise AFTER trade. Why not "negative favors floating payer"? Same reasoning: Fair pricing = zero at start. Becomes negative to fixed payer only if rates fall later. Not favoring either party at inception. Why not "equal to notional"? Notional is reference amount, not swap value. Value = difference in PV of two legs (typically $0-$5M range). Notional (e.g., $100M) would imply huge transfer of value. Analogy: Entering a fairly priced forward contract. At inception: Forward price set so no money exchanges hands (NPV = 0). Fair forward price: F = S × e^(rT) (no-arbitrage). Later: Spot moves → forward gains/loses value. But at start: Fair = zero NPV. Same for swaps: Fair swap rate = zero NPV at inception. Later fluctuations from rate changes. Important distinction: Swap RATE = 4.5% (the fixed rate agreed). Swap VALUE = $0 at inception (NPV of future cash flows). Rate stays fixed, value fluctuates daily.',

        question:
            'A bank has $50 billion of floating-rate assets (loans) and $50 billion of fixed-rate liabilities (bonds). What swap position helps hedge this risk?',
        options: [
            'Receive fixed, pay floating',
            'Pay fixed, receive floating',
            'No swap needed (naturally hedged)',
            'Buy interest rate options',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Bank should RECEIVE fixed, PAY floating to hedge. Asset-liability mismatch: Assets: $50B loans at floating rate (e.g., SOFR + 3%). Income rises/falls with SOFR. Liabilities: $50B bonds at fixed rate (e.g., 5% coupon). Expense fixed regardless of rates. Net interest margin (NIM): NIM = Asset_income - Liability_cost. Floating - Fixed = (SOFR + 3%) - 5% = SOFR - 2%. Risk: If SOFR falls below 2%: NIM negative (lose money). If SOFR rises above 2%: NIM positive (make money). Problem: Exposed to falling rates. Hedge with swap: Enter receive-fixed, pay-floating swap on $50B notional. Fixed rate: 4% (market swap rate). Floating rate: SOFR. Swap cash flows: Receive: 4% fixed × $50B = $2.0B annually. Pay: SOFR × $50B = varies. Net impact: Combined assets + liabilities + swap: Assets: SOFR + 3% → receive (SOFR + 3%) × $50B. Liabilities: 5% → pay 5% × $50B. Swap receive: 4% → receive 4% × $50B. Swap pay: SOFR → pay SOFR × $50B. Net: (SOFR + 3% + 4% - 5% - SOFR) × $50B = 2% × $50B = $1B fixed income. SOFR cancels out! Locked in $1B regardless of rate moves. Why receive-fixed works: Assets floating: Naturally pay floating (assets earn floating). Need to receive fixed to offset liability\'s fixed cost. Swap: Converts floating asset income to fixed. Combined: Fixed income from swapped assets matches fixed cost of liabilities. Duration match: Assets + Swap = Fixed, Liabilities = Fixed → balanced. Why not "pay fixed, receive floating"? That would ADD to rate risk: Assets: Floating (SOFR exposure). Swap: Pay fixed, receive floating (more SOFR exposure). Net: 2× SOFR exposure (worse). Liabilities still fixed → even more mismatch. Wrong direction (amplifies risk, not hedges). Why not "naturally hedged"? Natural hedge requires: Assets fixed + Liabilities floating, OR Assets floating + Liabilities floating (both sides move together). Here: Assets floating, Liabilities fixed = MISMATCH. Not hedged naturally → need swap. Why not "interest rate options"? Options possible but: Swap: Eliminates risk (locked in NIM). Cost: Swap spreads (small, 5-10bp). Options: Provide downside protection, keep upside. Cost: Premium paid (50-100bp or more). Complicated: Strike selection, expiration management. Swaps simpler, cheaper for ongoing hedge. Real-world example: Silicon Valley Bank (2023 failure): Assets: Long-term fixed-rate mortgages/bonds (not floating, but similar mismatch). Liabilities: Short-term floating-rate deposits. When rates rose: Deposit costs skyrocketed (paying higher rates). Asset income fixed (old mortgages at low rates). NIM crushed → insolvency. Should have: Pay floating (match deposit costs), receive fixed (match asset income). Or: Pay fixed, receive floating IF assets were floating (match both sides). Proper hedging via swaps could have prevented failure. Banking principle: Asset-Liability Management (ALM). Goal: Match duration/rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities. Tools: Interest rate swaps primary hedging instrument. Monitor: DV01 of assets vs liabilities, swap to balance.',

        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'DV01 = Dollar Value of a 1 basis point (0.01%) rate change. Definition: Change in swap value if entire yield curve shifts by 1bp. Measures interest rate sensitivity (first-order risk). Formula: DV01 ≈ -Duration × Value / 10,000. Or: Numerical bump: DV01 = (Value_down_1bp - Value_up_1bp) / 2. Example: 10-year pay-fixed swap, $100M notional. Value today: $0 (at inception). Curve shifts up 1bp: Value = $50,000 (positive). Curve shifts down 1bp: Value = -$50,000 (negative). DV01 = ($50K - (-$50K)) / 2 = $50,000 per bp. Interpretation: If rates fall 1bp: Swap gains $50K value (pay-fixed benefits). If rates rise 1bp: Swap loses $50K value. For 10bp move: Gain/loss ≈ $500K (10 × DV01). Linear approximation (works for small moves). Why important: Risk measurement: Quantifies rate sensitivity in dollars. Portfolio: Sum DV01 across all swaps = total rate exposure. Example: 50 swaps with various DV01s, total = $5M DV01. Interpretation: 10bp rate fall = $50M gain. Hedging: Offset DV01 with opposite positions. Pay-fixed swap: Negative DV01 (lose if rates rise). Hedge: Receive-fixed swap or short bond futures (positive DV01). Target: Net DV01 near zero (rate-neutral). Risk limits: Banks set DV01 limits per desk. Example: Max $10M DV01 per trader. Alert if exceeded → must reduce risk. Comparison to other measures: Duration: DV01 = Duration × Value / 10,000. Percentage measure vs dollar measure. Modified duration ≈ 7 for 10-year bond. DV01 = 7 × $100M / 10,000 = $70,000. Dollar duration: Same as DV01 (dollar-based sensitivity). PV01: Price value of 1bp, same concept (different name). Key rate duration: DV01 by maturity bucket (2yr, 5yr, 10yr separately). Why not "default value at inception"? That would be credit risk measure (expected loss from default). DV01 is interest rate risk, not credit risk. Credit risk: Measured by CVA (Credit Value Adjustment). Why not "daily valuation method"? Daily valuation = mark-to-market (MTM). Process of revaluing positions daily. DV01: Sensitivity measure (how much MTM changes with rates). Related but different: MTM = current value, DV01 = sensitivity of value. Why not "delivery versus payment"? DVP: Settlement convention (pay when receive security). Trade settlement terminology. Unrelated to DV01 (interest rate risk metric). Real-world application: Trading desk: Monitor DV01 exposure in real-time. Dashboard: Total DV01, DV01 by maturity bucket. Alerts: If DV01 exceeds limits. Hedging decision: DV01 = $5M, limit = $3M (exceeded). Action: Enter receive-fixed swap with $2M DV01 to offset. Result: Net DV01 = $5M - $2M = $3M (within limit). Risk reporting: Daily report to management: "Swap desk DV01: $12M long rates (benefit if rates fall 10bp = $1.2M gain)". Stress testing: 200bp rate rise scenario: Loss ≈ DV01 × 200 = $12M × 200 = $2.4B. But: DV01 is linear approximation (actual loss may differ due to convexity). For large moves: Include convexity adjustment. Higher-order terms: DV02 (convexity), DV03, etc. Typically small for swaps (low convexity compared to bonds).',
