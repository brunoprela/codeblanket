        question:
            'A portfolio has a delta of +200 (equivalent to long 200 shares). How should it be hedged to become delta-neutral?',
        options: ['Short 200 shares or equivalent', 'Long 200 shares', 'Buy 200 call options', 'No hedge needed'],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Short 200 shares to neutralize +200 delta. Delta hedging mechanics: Portfolio delta: +200 (long exposure equivalent to 200 shares). To neutralize: Need -200 delta (opposite exposure). Hedge: Short 200 shares (delta of short stock = -1 per share). Net result: +200 (portfolio) - 200 (hedge) = 0 (delta-neutral). Why delta-neutral: Insensitive to small price moves (hedged directional risk). Still exposed to: Gamma (delta changes as stock moves), Vega (volatility risk), Theta (time decay). Example: Stock $100, portfolio has +200 delta. Stock rises to $101 (+$1): Unhedged: Portfolio gains ~$200 (200 delta × $1). Hedged: Portfolio +$200, short stock -$200, Net ≈ $0. Stock falls to $99 (-$1): Unhedged: Portfolio loses ~$200. Hedged: Portfolio -$200, short stock +$200, Net ≈ $0. Dynamic nature: Delta changes: As stock moves, delta changes (gamma effect). Must rebalance: Continuously adjust hedge to maintain neutrality. Example: Stock rises, delta increases to +220, rebalance: Short additional 20 shares (total 220). Why not "long 200 shares"? Long adds delta: +200 (portfolio) + 200 (hedge) = +400 (amplifies exposure). Wrong direction: Makes position MORE directional, not neutral. Would use if: Portfolio was short -200 delta (then long 200 hedges it). Why not "buy 200 call options"? Call options: Have positive delta (adds to exposure). Delta per call: Typically 0.3-0.7 (not 1.0 like stock). Example: ATM calls delta 0.5, 200 calls = +100 delta. Result: +200 (portfolio) + 100 (calls) = +300 (worse). Calls also bring: Gamma, vega, theta (complicate hedge). Use calls when: Want to hedge gamma, not just delta. Why not "no hedge needed"? +200 delta: Significant directional exposure. Unhedged risk: Full exposure to stock price movements. $1 stock move: $200 P&L impact (large for most portfolios). Should hedge if: Goal is delta-neutral (eliminate directional risk). Practical considerations: Rebalancing frequency: Daily: Standard for option market makers. Intraday: For large positions or high gamma. Weekly: Acceptable for smaller positions. Transaction costs: Each rebalance: Bid-ask spread + commission. Too frequent: Costs eat into profits. Optimal: Balance frequency vs costs. Alternatives: Futures: Short 2 mini S&P futures (if S&P portfolio). ETFs: Short SPY shares (liquid, easy). Options: Sell calls (collect premium, hedge delta). Gamma risk: Delta hedge: Only first-order (linear). Large moves: Delta changes (gamma effect). Example: Stock +$5, delta increases to +250. Hedge inadequate: Short 200, but need 250 now. Loss: $50 × 50 shares = $2,500 unhedged. Gamma hedge: Would use options to neutralize gamma too.',

        question:
            'What is the primary goal of portfolio immunization in fixed income?',
        options: [
            'Match portfolio duration to liability duration to protect against rate changes',
            'Maximize portfolio returns',
            'Eliminate all investment risk',
            'Increase portfolio leverage',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Immunization matches portfolio duration to liability duration, protecting from rate changes. Core concept: Liability: Future payment obligation (e.g., pension payment in 7 years). Risk: Interest rates change → liability value changes. Goal: Structure portfolio so value moves match liability value moves. Solution: Match duration (portfolio duration = liability duration). Why duration matching works: Duration: Measures price sensitivity to rate changes. Liability duration 7 years: -7% value if rates +100bp. Portfolio duration 7 years: -7% value if rates +100bp. Net effect: Both move same amount → funding ratio stable. Example: Liability: $100M payment in 7 years, PV = $70M (at 5% rates). Portfolio: $70M bonds, duration 7 years. Scenario 1 - Rates rise to 6%: Liability PV: Decreases to $66M (discounted at 6%). Portfolio value: Decreases to ~$66M (duration effect). Funding ratio: Still ≈100% (both decreased proportionally). Scenario 2 - Rates fall to 4%: Liability PV: Increases to $75M. Portfolio value: Increases to ~$75M. Funding ratio: Still ≈100% (both increased). Why not "maximize returns"? Immunization: Defensive strategy (protect funding status). Not about returns: About matching assets to liabilities. Trade-off: May sacrifice return potential for stability. Return maximization: Different goal (active management, take risk). Pension funds: Need immunization (payments certain), don\'t want risk. Why not "eliminate all investment risk"? Immunization: Reduces interest rate risk. Residual risks: Credit risk (bonds may default), Liquidity risk (can\'t sell quickly), Reinvestment risk (coupons reinvested at unknown rates), Convexity mismatch (second-order effects for large moves). Not perfect: Small mismatches remain, rebalancing needed. Total elimination: Impossible without T-bills matching exact cash flows. Why not "increase leverage"? Leverage: Borrowing to amplify returns (increases risk). Immunization: Risk reduction (opposite of leverage). Pension funds: Typically avoid leverage (fiduciary duty). Could combine: Leveraged immunization (rare, complex). Limitations of duration matching: Assumes: Parallel yield curve shifts (all rates move together). Reality: Non-parallel shifts common (curve steepening/flattening). Solution: Key rate duration matching (match each maturity bucket). Convexity: Duration linear approximation, large moves need convexity matching. Callable bonds: Duration changes unexpectedly (negative convexity). Avoid or model carefully. Practical implementation: Step 1: Calculate liability duration (given payment schedule). Step 2: Select bonds to achieve target duration. Step 3: Optimize (minimize cost or maximize yield subject to duration constraint). Step 4: Monitor daily (durations drift as time passes and rates change). Step 5: Rebalance when off by >0.5 years. Real-world application: Pension funds: Match payment schedule to retiree payments. Insurance companies: Match policy payouts. Endowments: Match spending needs. Corporate treasurers: Match debt maturities. Historical example: Orange County (1994): Treasurer Robert Citron used leveraged strategies (opposite of immunization). Interest rates rose: Lost $1.6 billion (bankruptcy). Lesson: Speculating on rates = dangerous, immunization = safe.',

        question:
            'A gamma scalping strategy involves rebalancing a delta hedge as the stock price moves. What is required for this strategy to be profitable?',
        options: [
            'Realized volatility must exceed implied volatility',
            'Stock price must only move up',
            'Interest rates must be stable',
            'Correlation must be perfect',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Gamma scalping profitable when realized volatility > implied volatility. Strategy mechanics: Position: Long options (straddle or strangle), positive gamma. Delta hedge: Short stock to neutralize delta (delta-neutral). Stock moves: Delta changes (gamma effect), rebalance hedge. Rebalancing profit: Stock up: Delta increases, sell stock high (profit). Stock down: Delta decreases, buy stock low (profit). Key: Buy low, sell high from continuous rebalancing. Cost to overcome: Theta: Paying time decay daily (options lose value). Breakeven: Rebalancing profits must exceed theta cost. Profitability condition: Implied volatility: What you paid for options (embedded in premium). Example: IV = 25% (bought options priced at 25% vol). Realized volatility: Actual stock movement. Measure: Daily moves, annualized (sqrt(252) scaling). Profit if: Realized vol > Implied vol. Example: Paid for 25% vol, realized 30% vol → profit. Loss if: Realized vol < Implied vol. Example: Paid for 25%, realized 20% → loss. Mathematical: P&L from gamma scalping ≈ 0.5 × Gamma × (Realized_vol² - Implied_vol²) × Stock² × Time. Positive if realized > implied. Negative if realized < implied. Example scenario: Setup: Buy ATM straddle, S=$100, 30 days, IV=25%, cost=$5. Gamma = 0.05, Theta = -$20/day. Stock moves: Day 1: $100→$103 (+3%), rebalance, profit $45. Day 2: $103→$99 (-4%), rebalance, profit $80. Day 3-30: Continue rebalancing, total rebalancing profit $650. Costs: Theta: $20/day × 30 days = $600. Transaction costs: $50 total. Net P&L: $650 - $600 - $50 = $0 (breakeven). Realized vol: 3-4% daily moves = 30% annualized. Result: Realized (30%) > Implied (25%) → small profit. If realized was 20%: Rebalancing profits only $400. Costs $650 → Loss -$250. Why not "stock must only move up"? Gamma scalping: Profits from movement (either direction). Up or down: Both profitable (buy low / sell high from rebalancing). Ideal: Large moves in both directions (chop). Worst: Stock stuck (no rebalancing, only pay theta). Example: Stock oscillates $100→$105→$95→$102→$98. Many rebalances: High profits from buying low/selling high. Much better than: Stock $100→$110 (one move). Single rebalance: Limited profit. Why not "interest rates stable"? Interest rates: Affect option pricing (rho), but minor. Gamma scalping: Primarily about vol, not rates. Rates change: Small impact on theta/gamma relationship. Not critical: Can profit even with rate volatility. Matters more for: Long-dated options (years), short-term (days/weeks) less sensitive. Why not "correlation perfect"? Correlation: Relevant for multi-asset hedging. Single stock: No correlation issue. Delta hedge: Perfect for the underlying (not cross-hedging). Would matter if: Hedging IBM with SPY (correlation <1, basis risk). Here: Hedging stock with itself (correlation = 1 by definition). Practical considerations: Volatility forecast: Skill: Predicting realized > implied. Historical patterns: Earnings, events cause vol spikes. Timing: Enter when IV low (cheap options), Exit when IV high (expensive). Transaction costs: Each rebalance: Bid-ask spread (~$0.01-0.05/share). Frequent rebalancing: Costs add up quickly. Optimization: Balance rebalancing frequency vs costs. Typical: Rebalance when |delta| > 10-20 shares. Market makers: Gamma scalping core business. Natural: Make markets in options, hedge delta continuously. Edge: Tight bid-ask (lower costs), rebates (payment for liquidity). Retail: Harder (wider spreads, commissions). Historical example: LTCM (1998): Sold options (short gamma), collected theta. Market: Realized vol exploded in Russian crisis. Losses: Couldn\'t cover gamma losses with theta collected. Result: Bankrupt (leverage amplified losses).',

        question:
            'A company hedges its $100 million bond portfolio (duration 7 years) with Treasury futures (duration 7 years, $100,000 per contract). How many futures contracts should it short?',
        options: ['1,000 contracts', '100 contracts', '10,000 contracts', '10 contracts'],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Short 1,000 futures contracts to hedge $100M portfolio. Calculation: Portfolio value: $100,000,000. Portfolio duration: 7 years. Futures value: $100,000 per contract. Futures duration: 7 years (assume CTD has duration 7). Hedge ratio formula: Contracts = (Portfolio_value × Portfolio_duration) / (Futures_value × Futures_duration). Calculation: Numerator: $100M × 7 = $700M. Denominator: $100K × 7 = $700K. Contracts: $700M / $700K = 1,000. Short 1,000 futures contracts. Verification: Hedge value: 1,000 contracts × $100K = $100M (matches portfolio). Duration match: Both have duration 7 (matched). Rate sensitivity: Portfolio: $100M × 7 = $700M duration-adjusted. Futures: $100M × 7 = $700M duration-adjusted. Matched: Same sensitivity to rate changes. Example scenario: Rates rise 100bp (+1%): Portfolio loss: -$100M × 7 × 1% = -$7M. Futures gain: +$100M × 7 × 1% = +$7M (short profits when rates rise). Net: -$7M + $7M = $0 (hedged). Rates fall 100bp (-1%): Portfolio gain: +$7M. Futures loss: -$7M (short loses when rates fall). Net: $0 (hedged). Why not "100 contracts"? That would be: $100M / $100K = 100 (ignoring duration). Hedge value: 100 × $100K = $10M (only 10% of portfolio!). Severely under-hedged: Portfolio -$7M, Futures +$700K, Net -$6.3M loss. Missing: Duration multiplier (critical for fixed income). Why not "10,000 contracts"? That would be: Over-hedging by 10× (too many contracts). Hedge value: 10,000 × $100K = $1B (10× portfolio size!). Result: Rates rise: Portfolio -$7M, Futures +$70M, Net +$63M (huge gain). Rates fall: Portfolio +$7M, Futures -$70M, Net -$63M (huge loss). Over-hedged: Now have reverse exposure (10× bigger). Why not "10 contracts"? Severely under-hedged: Only $1M hedge vs $100M portfolio. Hedge value: 10 × $100K = $1M (0.01% of portfolio). Essentially unhedged: Rates move, huge losses unprotected. Refinements: Conversion factor: In reality, CTD bond may have CF ≠ 1.0. Adjust: Contracts = Hedge_ratio × (1 / CF). Example: CF = 0.95, Contracts = 1,000 / 0.95 = 1,053. Basis risk: Corporate bonds vs Treasury futures. Credit spreads: May widen independent of rates. Residual risk: Not perfectly hedged (only rate risk, not credit risk). Multiple durations: If portfolio has different duration (e.g., 8 years): Contracts = ($100M × 8) / ($100K × 7) = 1,143 (more contracts needed). Cross-hedge: Hedging duration mismatch. Key rate durations: More sophisticated: Match by maturity bucket (2yr, 5yr, 10yr separately). Requires: Multiple futures contracts (2yr, 5yr, 10yr futures). Better hedge: Non-parallel yield curve shifts. Real-world considerations: Rebalancing: Durations drift over time (bonds age, rates change). Monitor: Weekly or monthly. Rebalance: When duration mismatch > 10% (adjust futures). Costs: Futures margin: ~2-5% of notional (capital requirement). Rollover: Quarterly (futures expire, must roll to next contract). Basis: Typically 5-10bp cost annually. Alternatives: Swaps: OTC, customized duration. Options: Buy puts for downside only (asymmetric). Bond short: Direct short of Treasuries (harder, borrow costs).',

        question:
            'What is the main risk that remains after implementing a macro hedge using VIX call options?',
        options: [
            'Cost of the hedge (premium paid reduces returns)',
            'No risk remains',
            'Equity market risk',
            'Only credit risk',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Main risk: Cost of hedge (VIX call premiums drag on returns). Hedge mechanics: Portfolio: $100M long stocks/bonds. Hedge: Buy VIX call options (strike VIX 30, current VIX 15). Purpose: Protect against market crash (VIX spikes in crashes). Cost: VIX calls cost 1-2% of portfolio annually. Market crash scenario: VIX spikes: From 15 to 80 (5× increase). VIX calls: Gain 10-20× (huge payoff). Example: $1M premium → $10-20M payout. Portfolio: Falls 30% (-$30M). Net result: -$30M + $15M (avg) = -$15M loss (better than -$30M). Hedge worked: Limited downside, worth the cost. Normal market scenario: VIX stays low: Ranges 12-20 (calm markets). VIX calls: Expire worthless (out-of-money). Loss: Entire premium lost ($1M). Portfolio: Up 10% (+$10M in good year). Net result: +$10M - $1M = +$9M (hedge cost 1% drag). Cost of hedge: Annual drag: 1-2% of portfolio value. Over time: Reduces cumulative returns significantly. Example 10 years: Unhedged: 10% annual = 159% cumulative. Hedged: 9% annual (after 1% cost) = 137% cumulative. Opportunity cost: -22% over decade. Trade-off: Accept lower returns for downside protection. Insurance analogy: Like car insurance: Pay premium annually. Most years: No claim (premium "lost"). Crash year: Massive payout (justifies years of premiums). VIX hedge: Same concept (tail risk insurance). Why not "no risk remains"? Hedge imperfect: Timing: VIX may not spike immediately (early crash, VIX only at 25). Strike: If VIX 30 strike, gains only above 30 (some losses below). Size: Hedge only partial (75% portfolio, 25% unhedged). Basis risk: VIX measures S&P volatility, portfolio may differ. Costs: Premium paid (certain cost for uncertain benefit). Residual risks: Credit risk: VIX doesn\'t hedge credit spreads. Liquidity risk: Can\'t sell in crash. Idiosyncratic risk: Single stock blow-ups (not systemic). Why not "equity market risk"? Hedged partially: VIX calls offset market crashes (when VIX spikes). But: Not perfect (timing, strike, size issues above). Directional risk: Reduced, not eliminated. Still have: ~50-70% of equity risk (depending on hedge size). Better to say: Equity risk reduced but cost is main concern. Why not "only credit risk"? Multiple risks remain: Credit risk: Yes (VIX doesn\'t hedge credit spreads). Interest rate risk: Yes (VIX is equity vol, not rates). Liquidity risk: Yes (can\'t exit positions in panic). Idiosyncratic risk: Yes (single name blow-ups). Cost: Main practical concern (guaranteed drag every year). Optimal hedge sizing: Over-hedged: Costs too high (3-5% drag unacceptable). Under-hedged: Insufficient protection (20% loss still painful). Sweet spot: 1-2% annual cost, reduce crash from -30% to -15%. Effectiveness: Tail risk coverage (90th percentile+ bad outcomes). Not: Daily/monthly noise (accept normal volatility). Dynamic hedging: Increase hedge when: VIX rises (vol regime shift). Portfolio down >5% (trouble starting). Reduce hedge when: VIX <15 for 20 days (calm, expensive hedge). Bull market (opportunity cost too high). Alternatives: Protective puts: Similar concept, easier to understand. Out-of-money puts: 5-10% below, cheaper than ATM. Covered calls: Sell upside, fund put purchases (collar). CDX protection: Hedge credit risk (complement to VIX). Historical performance: 2008: VIX calls massive winners (VIX 80+). 2010-2019: Lost money 9 of 10 years (low vol decade). 2020: Huge winner (VIX 80 in March crash). Net: Positive risk-adjusted (prevented catastrophic losses).',
