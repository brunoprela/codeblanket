        question:
            'A 5-year CDS on Company X trades at 250 basis points. Assuming a 40% recovery rate and simplified pricing, what is the approximate implied annual default probability?',
        options: ['4.17%', '2.50%', '1.50%', '6.25%'],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Implied PD ≈ CDS Spread / LGD. Calculation: CDS spread: 250bp = 2.50% annually. Recovery rate: 40%. Loss Given Default (LGD): 1 - 0.40 = 0.60 (60%). Simplified formula: Annual_PD = CDS_spread / LGD. PD = 2.50% / 0.60 = 4.17% annually. Interpretation: Market implies 4.17% chance Company X defaults each year. Over 5 years: Cumulative PD ≈ 1 - (1-0.0417)^5 = 19% chance of default sometime in 5yr. Why this works: CDS spread compensates for expected loss. Expected_loss = PD × LGD. Rearranging: PD = Spread / LGD (simplified, ignores discounting). More precise: Include present value of payments, risky duration. But for quick estimate, this approximation works. Real-world context: 250bp spread indicates moderate-high credit risk. Investment grade (BBB): 100-200bp typical. High yield (BB-B): 300-700bp. CCC+: 700-2000bp. 250bp = borderline IG/HY territory. Compare to historical: BBB historical default rate: ~1% annually. Implied 4.17% much higher = market pricing elevated risk. Either: Company-specific issues, or market pricing pessimistically (crisis conditions). Why not 2.50%? That\'s just the spread percentage, not default probability. Ignores LGD adjustment. Would be correct only if LGD = 100% (zero recovery). Unrealistic: Even bankruptcies typically recover 20-40%. Why not 1.50%? Would be: 2.50% × 0.60 = 1.50% (multiplying, not dividing). Wrong direction: Higher LGD should mean HIGHER PD needed to justify same spread. Logic: If lose more per default (high LGD), fewer defaults needed to match spread. So PD should be lower, not higher. Wait, that contradicts...let me reconsider. Actually: Spread = PD × LGD. So PD = Spread / LGD. If LGD goes up, PD goes down for same spread (correct). 1.50% would be if formula were PD = Spread × LGD (wrong). Why not 6.25%? That would be: 2.50% / 0.40 (dividing by recovery instead of LGD). Wrong: Should divide by LGD (loss), not recovery (gain). Also: 6.25% annual PD is extremely high (near default probability). Would imply CCC rating or worse. 250bp spread not consistent with that level of risk. Refinement with risky duration: More precise: PD = Spread / (LGD × Risky_duration). Risky_duration ≈ 4.5 for 5yr (accounting for default risk). PD = 2.50% / (0.60 × 4.5) = 2.50% / 2.70 = 0.93% annually. Cumulative 5yr: ~4.5%. This is more accurate but requires knowing risky duration. Question asks for "simplified pricing" so 4.17% using LGD only is acceptable approximation.',

        question:
            'In a CDS contract, what happens to the protection buyer if a credit event (default) occurs?',
        options: [
            'Receives payment equal to (100% - Recovery Rate) × Notional',
            'Must pay additional premium',
            'Receives the full notional amount',
            'Loses their entire investment',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'Protection buyer receives (100% - Recovery Rate) × Notional. Mechanism: Credit event occurs: Company defaults (bankruptcy, failure to pay, or restructuring). ISDA determines: Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee votes. Official credit event declared. Settlement process: Option 1 - Cash settlement (standard post-2009): Auction: ISDA organizes recovery rate auction 30 days later. Determines: Final recovery rate (e.g., 30% of par). Protection seller pays: (100% - 30%) × Notional = 70% × Notional. Example: $10M notional, 30% recovery: Payment = $7M. Option 2 - Physical settlement (rare): Protection buyer: Delivers defaulted bonds ($10M face value). Protection seller: Pays par ($10M). Example with 30% recovery: Protection buyer receives: $10M (par from seller). Defaulted bonds worth: $3M (30% × $10M market value). Net gain: $10M - $3M = $7M (same as cash settlement). Why not "receives full notional"? That would mean seller pays 100% regardless of recovery. Ignores recovery value. Defaulted bonds typically worth 20-50% (not zero). Protection compensates for LOSS, not replaces entire value. Over-insurance not the purpose. Why not "must pay additional premium"? Premium payments STOP upon credit event. Final accrued premium paid (pro-rated to default date). Then contract terminates (settlement concludes it). No additional premium required. Why not "loses entire investment"? Protection buyer is like insurance holder. Paid premiums: Sunk cost (like insurance premiums). Receives payout: Recovers loss from default. Net result: Loss on position mitigated (if also owned bonds). If purely speculative CDS (no bond ownership): Paid premiums over time, receive payout. Net profit if payout > cumulative premiums paid. Historical examples: Lehman Brothers 2008: CDS auction: 8.625% recovery. Protection buyers received: 91.375% × Notional. $10M CDS: $9.1375M payout. Greece 2012: Greek government debt restructuring (credit event). Recovery: ~25% (harsh haircut). CDS payout: ~75% × Notional. Argentina 2001: Recovery: ~25-30%. CDS payout: 70-75%. Tax treatment: Payout typically taxed as ordinary income (not capital gains). Offsets: If held bonds, loss on bonds offsets CDS gain. Pure speculation: Full tax on gain. Accounting: Mark-to-market: Prior to default, CDS revalued daily. Spreads widen: Protection buyer sees MTM gain (anticipating payout). Default: Final settlement, recognize full gain/loss.',

            'What is the CDX.IG index?',
        options: [
            'Basket of 125 North American investment-grade CDS',
            'Credit rating for investment-grade bonds',
            'Index of 100 high-yield companies',
            'European credit default swap benchmark',
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'CDX.IG = Basket of 125 North American investment-grade CDS. Structure: Components: 125 companies (investment grade rated). Geographic: North America (US + Canada). Equal weight: Each name ~0.8% (1/125). Rollover: New series every 6 months (March, September). Example: CDX.IG Series 41: Latest on-the-run index. Previous: Series 40, 39, ... (off-the-run, less liquid). Trading: Spread: e.g., 60 basis points (weighted average of constituents). Notional: Standard $10M, but any size possible. Premium: 60bp × $10M = $60,000 annually (paid quarterly $15K). Protection: If any constituent defaults, payout on that name, index continues. Typical constituents: Financials: Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo. Technology: Apple, Microsoft (though rarely need CDS - strong credits). Industrials: Boeing, General Electric. Consumer: Walmart, McDonald\'s. Healthcare: UnitedHealth, Pfizer. Benefits: Liquidity: Most liquid credit product ($50B+ daily volume historically). Diversification: 125 names reduce idiosyncratic risk. Standardization: Easier to trade than assembling individual CDS basket. Benchmark: Market sentiment gauge (widening = risk-off, tightening = risk-on). Comparison to other indices: CDX.HY: 100 North American high-yield (junk) companies. Spread: 300-500bp typical (much wider than IG). iTraxx Europe: 125 European investment-grade. Similar to CDX.IG but European. iTraxx Crossover: 75 European high-yield. Similar to CDX.HY but European. Why not "credit rating"? CDX is a tradable index (derivatives product). Credit ratings: Moody\'s, S&P, Fitch (agencies, not instruments). Rating scale: Aaa/AAA to D (grades). Different concept entirely. Why not "100 high-yield companies"? That\'s CDX.HY (High Yield index). 100 constituents (not 125). Below investment grade (BB+ and below). CDX.IG is investment grade (BBB- and above). Different risk profile and spread levels. Why not "European benchmark"? That\'s iTraxx Europe (IG) or iTraxx Crossover (HY). European companies, European currency (EUR vs USD). Similar structure but different geography. CDX = North America, iTraxx = Europe. Applications: Hedging: Buy CDX.IG protection to hedge credit portfolio exposure. Cost-effective vs buying 125 individual CDS. Speculation: Directional bet on credit markets. Expect recession: Buy protection (spreads widen, gain). Expect growth: Sell protection (earn premium, spreads tighten). Relative value: CDX vs constituents basis trading. Long/short different series (roll spreads). Tranches: CDX tranches (equity, mezzanine, senior). Different risk/return profiles. Historical levels: 2007 pre-crisis: 40bp (tight, complacent). 2008 crisis: 250bp peak (panic). 2019: 50bp (benign). 2020 COVID: 130bp spike, then back to 60bp. 2023: 60-80bp range (moderate).',

            'Why did AIG require a government bailout in 2008?',

            'Massive CDS protection sold without adequate collateral/reserves',
            'Investment losses in stock market',

        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation:
            'AIG sold $500B+ CDS protection without adequate collateral, requiring $182B bailout. Timeline and mechanics: Pre-crisis (2005-2007): AIG Financial Products: Sold CDS protection on mortgage-backed securities (MBS), collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Premium income: Earned billions in premiums annually. Assumption: AAA-rated CDOs won\'t default (low risk, easy money). No reserves: Didn\'t set aside capital for potential payouts. No collateral posted: Counterparties (banks) didn\'t require initial margin (AIG had AAA rating). Size: $500+ billion notional exposure (massive). Crisis unfolds (2008): Housing crash: Mortgage defaults surge → MBS/CDOs lose value. Mark-to-market: CDS spreads widen dramatically (100bp → 1000bp+). MTM losses: AIG CDS portfolio loses tens of billions in value. Collateral calls: Banks demand collateral: "Post $10B by tomorrow or we liquidate." AIG problem: Can\'t meet calls (illiquid assets, no cash reserves). Downgrade spiral: Rating agencies downgrade AIG (AAA → AA → A). Triggers: More collateral requirements from downgrades. Self-fulfilling: Stress → downgrade → more stress → more downgrades. Systemic risk: Counterparties: Every major bank (Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, etc.). Exposure: Banks held billions in AIG CDS (hedging their MBS). If AIG defaults: Banks lose hedges, face massive losses. Contagion: Could trigger bank failures → financial system collapse. Government intervention: September 2008: Federal Reserve provides $85B emergency loan (later increased). Total: $182B committed over time. Terms: Government takes 79.9% equity stake. AIG survives: Gradually repays, gov't exits 2012 with small profit.Alternative scenarios: No bailout: AIG declares bankruptcy.Consequence: $500B CDS contracts worthless.Banks: Unhedged MBS exposure, massive losses, potential failures.System: Lehman × 10(AIG much larger, more interconnected). 2008 already catastrophic, would be far worse.Why AIG failed risk management: Underestimated: Correlation risk(mortgages default together, not independently).Tail risk: AAA CDOs could become worthless.Ignored: Collateral requirements if downgraded.Incentives: Executives earned bonuses on premium income(no clawback for losses).Model risk: Relied on Gaussian copula(criticized as flawed).Lessons: Counterparty risk: CDS seller default = systemic threat.Collateral: Initial + variation margin essential(now required post - Dodd - Frank).Central clearing: Mandate clearing for standardized CDS(reduces counterparty risk).Capital requirements: Basel III higher capital for derivatives.Rating agency risk: Don\'t assume AAA = safe (2008 proved otherwise). Why not "stock market losses"? AIG had investment portfolio, but CDS was the crisis trigger. Insurance operations: Actually profitable, stable. Problem: Financial Products division CDS exposure (small part of company, enormous risk). Stock losses: Secondary effect (portfolio declined during crisis). Not root cause of bailout need. Why not "real estate development"? AIG is insurance company, not real estate developer. Exposure to real estate: Indirect via MBS/CDOs (CDS sold on them). Direct real estate: Not significant part of business. Why not "currency trading"? AIG not primarily currency trader. Derivatives: CDS focus (credit derivatives, not FX). FX exposure: Incidental to global operations. Not material to 2008 crisis.',

        question:
    'What is "basis" in the context of CDS pricing?',
        options: [
            'Difference between CDS spread and bond spread for same issuer',
            'The recovery rate assumption',
            'The notional amount of the contract',
            'The frequency of premium payments',
        ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
                explanation:
    'CDS-bond basis = CDS spread - Bond spread (for same issuer/maturity). Theoretical relationship: CDS spread should equal bond credit spread (no-arbitrage). Both: Compensate for default risk of same issuer. CDS: Pure credit exposure (pay premium, receive if default). Bond: Credit + duration exposure (own bond, lose if default). Asset swap spread: Strip duration from bond using interest rate swap. Asset_swap_spread ≈ Bond_yield - Swap_rate. Parity: CDS_spread ≈ Asset_swap_spread. Both are pure credit, should equal. Actual basis: Basis = CDS_spread - Asset_swap_spread. Typically: 10-50bp (not zero). Positive basis: CDS trades wider than bond (CDS expensive, bond cheap). Negative basis: Bond trades wider than CDS (bond expensive, CDS cheap). Reasons for basis: Liquidity: CDS more liquid than cash bonds (especially for IG). Easier to trade: CDS synthetic exposure vs buying/selling bonds. Premium: CDS trades 10-20bp wider (liquidity premium). Funding: Bonds require capital to purchase. CDS synthetic (lower capital). Funding advantage: Cheaper to buy CDS than bond (repo costs). Cheapest-to-deliver: Bonds have different seniorities, maturities. CDS: Typically references senior unsecured. If senior secured bonds exist: Cheaper (higher recovery), drives basis. Restructuring: CDS may include/exclude restructuring as credit event. No-R (no restructuring) CDS: Tighter spread. Full R: Wider spread (more triggers). Technical factors: Supply/demand: Heavy issuance (supply) → bond spreads wider → basis negative. CDS demand: Hedgers buy protection → CDS spreads wider → basis positive. Trading strategies: Basis package: Buy bond + Buy CDS protection. Hedges: Duration (swapped), credit (CDS). Carry: Earn bond coupon - swap rate - CDS premium. Target: Positive carry + basis convergence. Example: Bond yield: 5.5%, Swap rate: 4.0%, CDS spread: 120bp, Carry: 5.5% - 4.0% - 1.2% = 0.3% annual. Basis: Asset swap spread = 5.5% - 4.0% = 150bp. Basis = 120bp - 150bp = -30bp (bond expensive). Trade: Short bond (sell), Sell CDS protection (receive premium). Profit: If basis narrows (-30bp → 0bp, convergence). Historical levels: 2007 pre-crisis: Basis near zero (efficient markets). 2008 crisis: Basis -100bp to +200bp (extreme dislocations). Liquidity crisis: Bonds illiquid, CDS traded (basis widened). Post-crisis: Basis 10-30bp typical (structural). Regulation: Dodd-Frank, Basel III favored CDS clearing (increased CDS demand). Why not "recovery rate"? Recovery rate: Assumption in CDS pricing (typically 40%). Input to model, not "basis." Basis: Market observable (difference between instruments). Recovery: Model parameter (varies by seniority, industry). Why not "notional amount"? Notional: Size of contract ($10M typical). Same as bond face value usually. Not a "difference" or "spread" concept. Basis specifically refers to spread differences. Why not "payment frequency"? Payment frequency: CDS premiums typically quarterly. Bond coupons: Semi-annual or annual. Frequency: Mechanical detail, not "basis" terminology. Basis: Pricing discrepancy between related instruments.',
