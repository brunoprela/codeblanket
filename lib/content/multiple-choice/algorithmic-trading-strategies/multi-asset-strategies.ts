Classic balanced portfolio. Historically: ~8% return, ~10% vol, Sharpe 0.8. 2022 challenged this (both stocks and bonds down). Alternatives gaining popularity.' },
    { id: 'ats-12-mc-2', question: 'Risk parity allocates based on:', options: ['Equal dollar amounts', 'Equal expected returns', 'Equal risk contribution', 'Market capitalization'], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: 'Correct: Equal risk contribution. Each asset contributes same amount to portfolio risk. Achieved by inverse volatility weighting. Low-vol assets (bonds) get higher weight, high-vol assets (equities) get lower weight.' },

Recession → lower earnings, higher unemployment → bonds outperform (flight to safety). Typical shift: 60/40 → 30/70 equities/bonds. Reduces drawdown from -30% to -15%.' },
    { id: 'ats-12-mc-5', question: 'Correlation between stocks and bonds is typically:', options: ['+0.8 (very positive)', '+0.3 (slightly positive)', '-0.3 (slightly negative)', '-0.8 (very negative)'], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: 'Correct: -0.3 (slightly negative). Historically, stocks and bonds negatively correlated (flight to quality). 2022 was unusual (+0.5 correlation, both down). Negative correlation provides diversification benefit.' },
