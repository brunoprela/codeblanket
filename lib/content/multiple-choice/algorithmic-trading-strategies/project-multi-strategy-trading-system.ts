    { id: 'ats-14-mc-1', question: 'Multi-strategy system with 3 uncorrelated strategies (Sharpe 1.0 each) has combined Sharpe:', options: ['1.0 (same)', '1.73 (√3)', '3.0 (sum)', '0.58 (1/√3)'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Correct: 1.73 (√3). With uncorrelated strategies, Sharpe scales as √N. Three strategies: √3 × 1.0 = 1.73. This is the power of diversification. If correlated (ρ=0.5), Sharpe ≈ 1.4.' },
    { id: 'ats-14-mc-2', question: 'Recommended max gross leverage for multi-strategy system:', options: ['1.0x (no leverage)', '2.0x (moderate)', '5.0x (high)', '10.0x (extreme)'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Correct: 2.0x (moderate). Allows 100% long + 100% short (market-neutral). Higher leverage (5x+) increases risk significantly. Lower (1x) limits strategy capacity. 2x is industry standard for diversified systems.' },
    { id: 'ats-14-mc-3', question: 'When should you reduce leverage in multi-strategy system?', options: ['Never, maintain constant exposure', 'When VIX >30 or drawdown >10%', 'Only when losing money', 'When winning to take profits'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Correct: When VIX >30 or drawdown >10%. High VIX indicates market stress → reduce risk. Drawdown >10% suggests strategies not working → de-risk. Risk management prevents large losses. Typical: reduce 25-50% when triggered.' },
    { id: 'ats-14-mc-4', question: 'Strategy correlation within multi-strategy portfolio should be:', options: ['1.0 (perfect)', '0.7+ (high)', '0.3-0.5 (moderate)', '<0.2 (low)'], correctAnswer: 3, explanation: 'Correct: <0.2 (low). Low correlation provides diversification. High correlation (>0.7) = concentration risk, strategies fail together. Ideal: <0.2 or even negative correlation (e.g., trend following vs mean reversion).' },
    { id: 'ats-14-mc-5', question: 'Expected Sharpe ratio for well-diversified multi-strategy system:', options: ['0.5-1.0', '1.5-2.5', '3.0-4.0', '>5.0'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Correct: 1.5-2.5. Individual strategies: 0.8-1.5 Sharpe. Multi-strategy with 3-5 uncorrelated strategies: 1.5-2.5 Sharpe. Top funds (Renaissance, Two Sigma) achieve 2.5-4.0 but rare. >5.0 is exceptional/unsustainable.' },
