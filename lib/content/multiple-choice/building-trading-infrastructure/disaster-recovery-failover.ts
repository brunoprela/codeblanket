        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation:
            'Answer: One server (active) processes orders, another (passive) is on standby.\n\n' +
            'Active-Passive pattern:\n' +
            '- **Active server**: Handles all production traffic\n' +
            '- **Passive server**: Standby, does not handle traffic\n' +
            '- **Failover**: If active fails, passive is promoted to active\n\n' +
            'Advantages:\n' +
            '- Simple (only one server active at a time)\n' +
            '- No split-brain problem (two servers thinking they\'re active)\n' +
            '- Data consistency (single source of truth)\n\n' +
            'Disadvantages:\n' +
            '- Passive server is idle (wasted resources)\n' +
            '- RTO typically 1-5 minutes (time to promote passive)\n\n' +
