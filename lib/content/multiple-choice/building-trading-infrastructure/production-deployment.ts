    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation:
      'Answer: It allows instant rollback with zero downtime.\n\n' +
      'Blue-Green deployment:\n' +
      '- **Green** has new version\n' +
      '- **Blue** has old version (still running)\n' +
      '- If green has bugs â†’ Switch back to blue (takes 1 second)\n\n' +
      'Rollback comparison:\n' +
      '- **Blue-Green**: 1 second (just switch traffic)\n' +
      '- **Rolling**: 10-30 minutes (redeploy old version to all servers)\n' +
      '- **Canary**: 5-10 minutes (shift traffic back to old version)\n\n' +
      'Why other options are wrong:\n' +
      '- **Cost**: Actually more expensive (2x infrastructure)\n' +
      '- **Testing**: Still requires same testing\n' +
      '- **Speed**: Same deployment speed as others\n\n' +
