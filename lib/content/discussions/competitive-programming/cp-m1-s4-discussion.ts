      question:
        'Compare the advantages and disadvantages of using Competitive Companion + CP Editor vs manual copy-paste workflow. When would you choose one over the other?',
      answer: `The modern tool ecosystem can significantly improve your competitive programming workflow. Let's analyze the trade-offs:

**Manual Copy-Paste Workflow:**

Process:
1. Read problem on website
2. Copy sample inputs to local file
3. Code solution
4. Test manually
5. Copy code back to website
6. Submit

Advantages:
✅ No dependencies - works everywhere
✅ Simple and straightforward
✅ No setup required
✅ Full control over process
✅ Works offline (after reading problem)
✅ No tools to break or update

Disadvantages:
❌ Tedious copy-paste process
❌ Manual input file creation
❌ Easy to make mistakes copying
❌ Slower overall workflow
❌ No automatic testing
❌ More context switching

Time cost: ~1-2 minutes per problem for setup

**Competitive Companion + CP Editor:**

Process:
1. Parse problem with browser extension (1 click)
2. Auto-creates file with test cases
3. Code solution
4. Auto-test on samples
5. Submit directly from editor

Advantages:
✅ Saves 1-2 minutes per problem on setup
✅ Auto-parses sample inputs/outputs
✅ One-click testing against samples
✅ Immediate feedback (pass/fail)
✅ Supports multiple platforms
✅ Less prone to copy-paste errors
✅ Better workflow for multiple problems
✅ Can submit directly from editor

Disadvantages:
❌ Requires initial setup
❌ Browser extension needed
❌ Tool integration can break
❌ Platform updates may break parsing
❌ Dependency on external tools
❌ Learning curve for setup
❌ May not work on all platforms
❌ Requires internet for parsing

Time cost: 5-10 seconds per problem after setup

**When to Use Manual Workflow:**

1. **New environment/computer**: Quick to start without setup
2. **Platform not supported**: Tool doesn't support the judge
3. **Tools broken**: After platform update breaks parsing
4. **Simple contest**: Only 1-2 problems
5. **Reliability critical**: Contest where you can't risk tool failures
6. **Learning phase**: When you're just starting CP

**When to Use Automated Tools:**

1. **Regular practice**: Time savings add up
2. **Long contests**: Multiple problems benefit from speed
3. **Supported platforms**: Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.
4. **Your main computer**: Setup is worth it
5. **Virtual contests**: Speed matters for rating
6. **After mastering basics**: When workflow is your bottleneck

**Hybrid Approach (Recommended):**

Use automation as primary with manual as backup:

\`\`\`
Primary: Competitive Companion + CP Editor
        - Use for 90 % of problems
- Fast and efficient

Backup: Manual workflow
    - Use when tools fail
        - Use on unfamiliar systems
            - Use during critical contests if uncertain
                \`\`\`

**Time Impact Analysis:**

In a 2-hour contest with 5 problems:

Manual:
- Setup: 5 × 1.5 minutes = 7.5 minutes
- Testing: Manual, slower
- Total overhead: ~10 minutes

Automated:
- Setup: 5 × 10 seconds = 50 seconds
- Testing: Automatic, instant feedback
- Total overhead: ~2 minutes

**Savings: 8 minutes** = Potentially enough to solve another problem!

**My Recommendation:**

1. **Learn manual first** (understand the process)
2. **Set up tools** (one-time 30-minute investment)
3. **Use tools regularly** (build muscle memory)
4. **Keep manual skills** (as backup)
5. **Test tools before important contests** (ensure they work)

**Pro Tip:** Set up tools on your main practice machine, but be comfortable with manual workflow for contests where reliability is critical (like ICPC regionals).`,

      question:
        'Explain how to use competitive programming tools for effective stress testing. Why is stress testing important and what kinds of bugs does it catch that sample tests might miss?',
      answer: `Stress testing is one of the most powerful debugging techniques in competitive programming. Here's why and how:

**What is Stress Testing?**

Generating many random test cases and comparing your solution against a brute force reference solution.

Basic idea:
\`\`\`
    for many iterations:
    generate random test case
    run your solution
    run brute force solution
    if outputs differ:
        found bug!
        show the failing test case
    \`\`\`

**Why Stress Testing is Crucial:**

**1. Sample Tests are Limited:**
- Usually 2-4 examples
- Often designed to show the algorithm, not break it
- Don't cover edge cases comprehensively
- May not test maximum constraints

**2. Stress Testing Finds:**
- Edge cases you didn't think of
- Off-by-one errors
- Integer overflow on specific values
- Algorithm errors on certain patterns
- Race conditions in certain orderings

**3. Real Contest Value:**
- Catches bugs before submission (avoids WA penalty)
- Finds bugs that only appear on judge's tests
- Builds confidence in solution correctness

**Setting Up Stress Testing:**

**Step 1: Write Brute Force Solution (brute.cpp)**

\`\`\`cpp
    #include < bits / stdc++.h >
        using namespace std;

// Simple, obviously correct solution (even if slow)
int bruteSolve(vector < int > a) {
    int n = a.size();
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;

        // Try all subarrays O(n²) - slow but correct
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                sum += a[j];
                maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
            }
        }
        return maxSum;
    }

int main() {
    int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector < int > a(n);
        for (int & x : a) cin >> x;

        cout << bruteSolve(a) << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    \`\`\`

**Step 2: Write Test Generator (gen.cpp)**

\`\`\`cpp
    #include < bits / stdc++.h >
        using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
        srand(atoi(argv[1]));  // Seed from command line
    
    int n = rand() % 10 + 1;  // Array size 1-10
        cout << n << endl;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int val = rand() % 21 - 10;  // Values -10 to 10
            cout << val << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;

        return 0;
    }
    \`\`\`

**Step 3: Write Stress Test Script (stress.sh)**

\`\`\`bash
#!/bin/bash

# Compile all programs
    g++ - std=c++17 - O2 solution.cpp - o solution
    g++ - std=c++17 - O2 brute.cpp - o brute
    g++ - std=c++17 - O2 gen.cpp - o gen

# Run tests
    for ((i = 1; i <= 1000; i++)); do
    ./ gen $i > input.txt
            ./ solution < input.txt > out1.txt
                ./ brute < input.txt > out2.txt
    
    if !diff - q out1.txt out2.txt > /dev/null; then
        echo "Found difference on test $i!"
        echo "Input:"
        cat input.txt
        echo "Your output:"
        cat out1.txt
        echo "Expected output:"
        cat out2.txt
    break
    fi

    if ((i % 100 == 0)); then
        echo "Passed $i tests..."
    fi
    done

    if ((i > 1000)); then
    echo "All 1000 tests passed!"
    fi
        \`\`\`

**Step 4: Run Stress Test**

\`\`\`bash
    chmod + x stress.sh
        ./ stress.sh
            \`\`\`

**Types of Bugs Stress Testing Catches:**

**1. Edge Cases:**

Example: Array with single element
\`\`\`
    Input: n = 1, a = [5]
Your solution: 0(bug: didn't handle n=1)
Brute force: 5(correct)
        \`\`\`

**2. Off-by-One Errors:**

Example: Loop goes one too far
\`\`\`
Input: n = 5, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Your solution: Segfault(accessed a[5])
Brute force: 15
        \`\`\`

**3. Integer Overflow:**

Example: Specific values cause overflow
\`\`\`
Input: a = [1000000, 1000000]
Your solution: -1294967296(overflow!)
Brute force: 2000000
        \`\`\`

**4. Algorithm Errors on Patterns:**

Example: All negative numbers
\`\`\`
Input: n = 3, a = [-5, -2, -8]
Your solution: 0(bug: returns 0 for empty subarray)
Brute force: -2(correct: best subarray is[-2])
        \`\`\`

**5. Boundary Conditions:**

Example: Maximum/minimum values
\`\`\`
    Input: a = [INT_MAX, 1]
Your solution: INT_MIN(overflow on addition)
Brute force: Correct handling
        \`\`\`

**Advanced Stress Testing Techniques:**

**1. Targeted Generation:**

Generate tests that stress specific aspects:

\`\`\`cpp
    // Generate sorted arrays
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = i;

    // Generate all same values
    fill(a.begin(), a.end(), 42);

    // Generate worst case
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = n - i;
    \`\`\`

**2. Binary Search the Bug:**

When test is too large to understand:

\`\`\`bash
# If test with n = 1000 fails, try smaller:
# Test n = 500, if passes bug is in second half
# Test n = 750, etc.
# Binary search to find minimum failing case
    \`\`\`

**3. Property-Based Testing:**

Check properties that should always hold:

\`\`\`cpp
    // Property: Solution should be >= max element
    assert(result >= * max_element(a.begin(), a.end()));

// Property: Solution should be <= sum of all positive elements
long long sumPositive = 0;
    for (int x : a) if (x > 0) sumPositive += x;
    assert(result <= sumPositive);
    \`\`\`

**4. Time-Limited Stress Test:**

\`\`\`bash
# Run for 1 minute
timeout 60s./ stress.sh
        \`\`\`

**Real-World Example:**

Problem: Find maximum sum of subarray

Your optimized solution (Kadane's):
\`\`\`cpp
int maxSubarray(vector < int > a) {
    int maxSum = 0, currSum = 0;  // BUG: should initialize maxSum to INT_MIN
        for (int x : a) {
            currSum = max(0, currSum + x);
            maxSum = max(maxSum, currSum);
        }
        return maxSum;
    }
    \`\`\`

Sample tests: All pass (arrays with positive numbers)

Stress test finds:
\`\`\`
    Input: n = 3, a = [-5, -2, -8]
Your output: 0
    Expected: -2
BUG FOUND!
        \`\`\`

The bug: When all numbers are negative, your solution returns 0 (empty subarray), but correct answer is the least negative number.

**Tools for Stress Testing:**

**1. Built-in to CP Editors:**
- CP Editor: Has stress testing feature
- Hightail: Specialized stress testing tool

**2. Scripts:**
- Shell scripts (Linux/Mac)
- Batch scripts (Windows)
- Python scripts (cross-platform)

**3. Testlib (Codeforces):**
\`\`\`cpp
    #include "testlib.h"

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
        registerGen(argc, argv, 1);
    
    int n = rnd.next(1, 10);
        cout << n << endl;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cout << rnd.next(-10, 10) << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    \`\`\`

**Best Practices:**

1. **Always write brute force first**: Verify correctness before optimizing
2. **Test on small n first**: Easier to debug failing cases
3. **Gradually increase n**: Find where optimization breaks
4. **Use random seed**: Reproducible tests (seed from iteration number)
5. **Save failing cases**: Keep them for regression testing
6. **Stress test before submit**: Especially on problems you're uncertain about

**Time Investment:**

- Writing brute + generator: 5-10 minutes
- Running stress test: 1-2 minutes
- Total: ~10 minutes

**Payoff:**

- Catches bugs before submission (saves 5-20 minutes debugging WA)
- Increases confidence in solution
- Often worth the time investment!

**When to Stress Test:**

✅ Complex algorithm (not obvious it's correct)
✅ Problem has tricky edge cases
✅ You're uncertain about solution
✅ Time permits (not rushing)
✅ High-value problem (worth extra time)

❌ Very simple problem (sorting array)
❌ Time is tight (need to move on)
❌ Can't think of brute force

**Summary:**

Stress testing is a superpower that finds bugs sample tests miss. Invest 10 minutes setting it up, and it can save you from frustrating WA verdicts on problems where your algorithm is almost correct but fails on edge cases you didn't consider.`,

        `The right development environment can significantly boost your competitive programming performance. Here's what matters:

**Essential Features:**

**1. Fast Compilation and Execution**

Must-have:
- One-keystroke compile+run (e.g., Ctrl+B)
- Display output in integrated terminal
- Input redirection from file

Setup:
\`\`\`json
    // VS Code tasks.json
    {
        "label": "C++ Compile & Run",
            "type": "shell",
                "command": "g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall ${file} -o ${fileDirname}/solution && ${fileDirname}/solution < ${fileDirname}/input.txt",
                    "group": { "kind": "build", "isDefault": true },
        "presentation": { "reveal": "always", "panel": "new" }
    }
    \`\`\`

Benefit: Saves 5-10 seconds per test

**2. Smart Code Completion**

What to look for:
- STL container methods autocomplete
- Function signatures shown
- Parameter hints
- Template argument hints

Example: Type \`v.\` and see all vector methods

Setup (VS Code):
- Install C/C++ extension
- Enable IntelliSense
- Configure include paths

**3. Syntax Highlighting & Error Detection**

Must-have:
- Immediate error underlines (before compilation)
- Warning indicators
- Bracket matching
- Indentation guides

Catches errors like:
\`\`\`cpp
    vector < int > v  // Missing semicolon - should be underlined
        \`\`\`

**4. Multiple Test Cases Management**

Feature: Switch between test inputs easily

Setup:
\`\`\`
    problem /
├── solution.cpp
├── test1.txt
├── test2.txt
├── test3.txt
└── expected /
    ├── test1.txt
    ├── test2.txt
    └── test3.txt
        \`\`\`

Script to test all:
\`\`\`bash
    for test in test *.txt; do
    echo "Testing $test"
            ./ solution < $test
done
        \`\`\`

**5. Template Snippets**

Setup snippets for instant insertion:

VS Code snippets:
\`\`\`json
    {
        "CP Template": {
            "prefix": "cptemplate",
                "body": [
                    "#include <bits/stdc++.h>",
                    "using namespace std;",
                    "",
                    "void solve() {",
                    "    $0",
                    "}",
                    "",
                    "int main() {",
                    "    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);",
                    "    cin.tie(nullptr);",
                    "    solve();",
                    "    return 0;",
                    "}"
                ]
        }
    }
    \`\`\`

Type \`cptemplate\` + Tab = instant template!

**6. Split View for Problem Statement**

Setup:
- Left panel: Problem (browser or markdown)
- Right panel: Code
- Bottom: Terminal

Benefit: No context switching between windows

**Customization for Maximum Efficiency:**

**1. Keybindings**

Set up fast access:
\`\`\`
    Ctrl + B: Compile and run
    Ctrl + Shift + B: Compile only
    Ctrl + T: Run tests
    Ctrl + \`: Toggle terminal
Ctrl+P: Quick file open
\`\`\`

        ** 2. Auto - Save **

            Enable:
    \`\`\`json
"files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
"files.autoSaveDelay": 1000
\`\`\`

Never lose code due to forgot to save!

        ** 3. Font and Theme **

            Readable font:
    - Consolas, Monaco, Fira Code, JetBrains Mono
        - Size: 14 - 16pt
            - Line height: 1.5

    Theme:
    - Dark theme for long sessions(less eye strain)
        - High contrast for visibility

            ** 4. Minimap **

            Enable minimap for quick navigation in long code

                ** 5. Line Numbers **

                    Always on - helps when compiler shows error on line X

                        ** 6. Format on Save **

                            Auto - format code:
    \`\`\`json
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"C_Cpp.clang_format_style": "{ BasedOnStyle: Google, IndentWidth: 4, TabWidth: 4 }"
\`\`\`

        ** 7. Terminal Integration **

            Split terminal view:
    - Top: Output
