  description: `A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array \`nums\`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that \`nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž\`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(log n)** time.`,
  examples: [
    {
      input: 'nums = [1,2,3,1]',
      output: '2',
      explanation:
        '3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.',
    },
    {
      input: 'nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]',
      output: '5',
      explanation:
        'Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.',
    },
  ],
  constraints: [
    '1 <= nums.length <= 1000',
    '-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1',
    'nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i',
  ],
  hints: [
    'Use binary search',
    'If nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1], there must be a peak in the right half',
    'Otherwise, there must be a peak in the left half (including mid)',
  ],
