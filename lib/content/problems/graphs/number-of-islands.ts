  title: 'Number of Islands',
  difficulty: 'Easy',
  description: `Given an \`m x n\` 2D binary grid \`grid\` which represents a map of \`'1'\`s (land) and \`'0'\`s (water), return **the number of islands**.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.


**Approach:**
This is a **connected components** problem. Use DFS or BFS to explore each island, marking visited cells. Each time we start a new DFS/BFS, we've found a new island.

**Key Insight:**
Think of the grid as an implicit graph where each land cell is connected to its adjacent land cells (up, down, left, right).`,

  hints: [
    'Iterate through each cell in the grid',
    'When you find a "1" (unvisited land), increment island count',
    'Run DFS/BFS from that cell to mark all connected land as visited',

    'Mark visited cells by changing "1" to "0" or use a visited set',
