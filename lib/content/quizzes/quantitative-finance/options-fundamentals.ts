    question:
      'You own a portfolio of tech stocks worth $500,000 and are concerned about a potential market correction in the next 3 months. Design a protective strategy using options. Specify: (1) which option strategy you would use and why, (2) how to determine the appropriate strike price, (3) how to calculate the cost vs protection tradeoff, (4) position sizing considerations, (5) when to roll or exit the position. Include calculations and risk analysis.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Protective put strategy for portfolio hedging: (1) Strategy: Buy SPY or QQQ put options (tech-heavy index) rather than individual stock puts for diversification and liquidity. Alternative: Collar strategy (buy puts + sell calls) to reduce cost. (2) Strike selection: Determine acceptable drawdown. For 10% protection, buy puts at 90% of current index price. Example: SPY at $450 → buy $405 strike puts. In-the-money puts (strike > spot) provide more protection but cost more. Out-of-money puts (strike < spot) are cheaper but leave a gap. Rule: OTM puts for tail risk, ATM/ITM for full protection. (3) Cost calculation: If $405 put costs $8, portfolio beta to SPY is 1.2. Shares needed: ($500k * 1.2) / $450 = 1,333 shares = 13.33 contracts. Total cost: 13.33 * $8 * 100 = $10,664 (2.1% of portfolio). Annualized insurance: 2.1% * 4 = 8.4% if rolled quarterly. Compare to: Stop losses (no cost, but gap risk), diversification (limited in sector concentration), cash reserves (opportunity cost). (4) Position sizing: Match beta-adjusted portfolio value. Too few contracts = under-hedged. Too many = speculation. Calculate portfolio delta and match with put delta. (5) Rolling strategy: If market drops 5%, put gains offset stock losses. If market rises, let puts expire worthless (paid for peace of mind). Roll when: 30 days to expiration (theta accelerates), implied volatility spikes (sell high IV, buy later), underlying recovers (take profits, re-hedge lower). Exit if: Market stabilizes, reduce equity exposure instead, premium becomes too expensive (>5% portfolio annually). Risk: Puts expire worthless in bull market (insurance cost). Basis risk if individual stocks diverge from index. Overpaying in low volatility periods. Alternative: Collar strategy: Buy $405 put, sell $495 call for net cost $2 (vs $8 put-only). Caps upside at $495 but reduces insurance cost by 75%.',

    question:
      'Compare covered call and cash-secured put strategies for generating income. For each: (1) explain the mechanics and risk profile, (2) calculate returns including assignment scenarios, (3) determine optimal strike selection (delta targeting), (4) tax implications, (5) when each strategy is superior. Assume: XYZ stock at $100, 30-day options available at multiple strikes. Include concrete examples with P&L calculations.',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Income strategy comparison: COVERED CALL: (1) Mechanics: Own 100 shares at $100, sell 1 call option. Collect premium, accept obligation to sell at strike if assigned. (2) Example strike selection: Sell $105 call (10% OTM) for $2 premium. Max return: Stock at $105+ = ($105-$100) + $2 = $7 (7% in 30 days = 84% annualized). Stock flat at $100 = $2 premium (2% return = 24% annualized). Stock drops to $95 = -$5 + $2 = -$3 loss (3%). Breakeven: $98 (cost basis - premium). (3) Delta targeting: Sell 0.30-delta calls (30% probability ITM) for balance of premium vs assignment risk. Higher delta (0.50) = more premium but likely assignment. Lower delta (0.15) = keeps stock but minimal income. Target: 0.30-0.40 delta = 2-3% monthly premium with 60-70% probability of keeping stock. (4) Risk: Unlimited downside (own stock), capped upside (called away). Miss out on rallies above strike. Stock drops $20 but only collected $2 premium. CASH-SECURED PUT: (1) Mechanics: Set aside $10,000 cash, sell 1 put at $100 strike for $2.50 premium. Collect premium, accept obligation to buy at $100 if assigned. (2) Example: If XYZ at $105 at expiration, put expires worthless, keep $250 premium (2.5% on $10k = 30% annualized). If XYZ at $95, assigned stock at $100 (paid $95 + lost $5), but collected $250, effective basis $97.50 (better than market). If XYZ at $90, assigned at $100, down $1,000 offset by $250 = $750 loss. (3) Delta targeting: Sell 0.30-delta puts for similar probability. Collect slightly more premium than calls (put skew). (4) Risk: Same as covered call (both are synthetically equivalent via put-call parity). COMPARISON: Covered call better when: (1) Already own stock (no tax trigger from buying), (2) Bullish to neutral (keep upside to strike), (3) Established positions. Cash-secured put better when: (1) Want to acquire stock at lower price, (2) Don't own stock yet (no cash outlay until assigned), (3) Bullish signal (willing to buy dip). TAX: Covered call: Reduces cost basis, potential short-term gain if called away. Wash sale if called away and repurchase within 30 days. Cash-secured put: No tax until assignment, then establishes cost basis. Long-term gain clock starts at assignment. OPTIMIZATION: Wheel strategy: Sell cash-secured puts → get assigned → sell covered calls → get called away → repeat. Avg 2-3% monthly premium = 24-36% annual yield. Risk: Declining stock (lose on shares, premium insufficient). Works best on quality stocks with moderate volatility (30-50% IV).",

    question:
      'Design an iron condor strategy for earnings announcements. Explain: (1) how to structure the position (strike selection, position sizing), (2) implied volatility considerations (IV crush), (3) calculating probability of profit, (4) adjustments if the stock moves against you, (5) comparing to other volatility strategies (straddle, strangle). Assume: AAPL at $180, earnings tomorrow, IV at 60% (high), typically drops to 30% post-earnings.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Iron condor for earnings IV crush: (1) Structure: Exploit high implied volatility before earnings, expecting IV to drop post-announcement. Setup: Buy $165 put, sell $170 put, sell $190 call, buy $195 call. Premiums: -$1 (long $165 put), +$3 (short $170 put), +$3 (short $190 call), -$1 (long $195 call). Net credit: $4 per share = $400 per iron condor (1 contract each leg). Max profit: $400 (stock between $170-$190 at expiration). Max loss: ($190-$170) - $400 = $600 (stock outside wings). (2) Strike selection: Short strikes outside expected move. Expected move = Stock price * IV * sqrt(DTE/365). $180 * 0.60 * sqrt(1/365) = $5.63 (1-day move). One standard deviation: $180 ± $5.63 = $174.37 - $185.63. Two standard deviations: $168.74 - $191.26. Structure: Put spread at 2σ below ($165-$170), call spread at 2σ above ($190-$195). Probability of profit ≈ 70-80% (inside 2σ). (3) IV crush advantage: Before earnings IV=60%, after earnings IV=30% (50% drop). Options lose extrinsic value even if stock doesn\'t move. Close position day after earnings to capture IV crush without holding to expiration. If opened at $4 credit and IV drops, may close at $1 debit = $3 profit (75% of max profit). (4) Adjustments if breached: Stock jumps to $195 (call side breached): Close call spread immediately (take $600 loss on call side, keep $400 put spread profit = -$200 net). Or, roll call spread higher ($195/$200) for additional credit. Stock drops to $165 (put side breached): Close put spread, keep call spread. Or, convert to "big tent" by closing put spread and opening wider put spread. (5) Comparison to other strategies: IRON CONDOR vs LONG STRADDLE: Straddle = buy call + put at same strike ($180). Costs $15 per share = $1,500 total. Needs >$15 move to profit. Profits from big move, loses from IV crush. Iron condor = opposite bet (no big move, collect IV crush). IRON CONDOR vs SHORT STRADDLE: Short straddle = sell call + put at $180. Collects ~$15 but has unlimited risk on both sides. Iron condor limits max loss to $600 (defined risk). SHORT STRANGLE vs IRON CONDOR: Short strangle = sell OTM put + call without protective wings. Higher credit ($8 vs $4) but undefined risk. Iron condor = defined risk version (pay for wings). BEST USE: Iron condor for earnings when: (1) High IV (>50%) will crush post-earnings, (2) Expect muted reaction (stock stays in range), (3) Historical earnings moves < expected move, (4) Defined risk is required (smaller account). Long straddle when: (1) Expecting big move (>10%), (2) Direction uncertain, (3) IV is low relative to potential move. PROBABILITY CALCULATION: P(profit) ≈ 1 - P(outside $170-$190). Assuming normal distribution: P(stock < $170) = CDF(-10/5.63) ≈ 3.8%, P(stock > $190) = CDF(10/5.63) ≈ 3.8%. P(profit) ≈ 92%. But: Fat tails in reality reduce this to ~70-75%. Account for tail risk. POSITION SIZING: Risk $600 per iron condor. For $100k account with 2% risk per trade = $2,000 risk. Max 3 iron condors = $1,800 risk. But: Earnings are binary events with higher tail risk. Reduce to 1-2 contracts max (0.6-1.2% portfolio risk).',
