      question:
        'You run an Engle-Granger cointegration test on two stocks (A and B) and get p-value = 0.03 (cointegrated), hedge ratio β = 0.4, and half-life = 15 days. However, when you backtest the pairs trade over the past 2 years, you find the Sharpe ratio is only 0.3 and there were two instances where the spread exceeded 6σ before eventually reverting. Should you trade this pair? Explain your decision process, considering statistical significance, half-life, backtested performance, and tail risk.',
      sampleAnswer: `**Decision: Do NOT trade this pair** despite statistical cointegration (p<0.05). Here\'s my reasoning: (1) **Half-life too long**: 15 days is at the upper boundary of acceptable range (5-20 days). Longer half-lives tie up capital and increase risk that cointegration breaks before reversion. With 15-day half-life, positions take 30-45 days to fully revert, exposing the trade to multiple regime-changing events. (2) **Backtest Sharpe too low**: 0.3 Sharpe is below the acceptable threshold for pairs trading (target 0.8-1.5). This suggests either (a) transaction costs are eroding profits, (b) entry/exit timing is poor, or (c) the cointegration is weak (spread reverts slowly and inconsistently). (3) **Tail risk evident**: Two 6σ events in 2 years is alarming-under normal distribution, 6σ should occur once every 500 million observations, not twice in 500 days. This indicates fat tails (non-normal distribution) and suggests cointegration temporarily broke during stress periods. These are exactly the events that cause catastrophic losses. (4) **Statistical vs economic significance**: While p-value 0.03 is statistically significant, economic significance (profitability after costs) is what matters. The low Sharpe indicates this relationship isn\'t economically exploitable. **Alternative actions**: (a) Test on out-of-sample data to check if cointegration persists, (b) Examine the 6σ events-what caused them? Are they predictable (earnings, sector rotations)? (c) Optimize entry/exit thresholds (maybe 1.5σ entry instead of 2σ), (d) Consider tighter stop-loss (3σ instead of 4σ) to limit tail losses. **Bottom line**: Cointegration alone isn\'t sufficient-need fast reversion (short half-life), strong backtested performance (Sharpe >0.8), and absence of tail events. This pair fails on all three criteria.`,

      question:
        'You manage a 50-pair stat arb portfolio with $100M AUM. Each pair has half-life 8 days, Sharpe 1.2 (individual), and 0.25 average pairwise correlation. Your annual transaction costs are 15 bps per round-trip, and you rebalance when spread hits ±2σ (entry) or 0σ (exit). Calculate: (a) expected portfolio Sharpe ratio, (b) expected annual turnover, (c) impact of transaction costs on net returns, and (d) capacity constraints-at what AUM does the strategy become unprofitable?',
      sampleAnswer: `**(a) Portfolio Sharpe ratio**: With 50 uncorrelated pairs, portfolio variance = individual variance / √N (diversification benefit). However, pairs have 0.25 correlation on average, so: Portfolio vol = Individual vol × √(1/N + (N-1)/N × ρ) = σ × √(1/50 + 49/50 × 0.25) = σ × √0.265 = 0.515σ. Since Sharpe = Return/Vol, and returns scale linearly but vol scales sub-linearly: Portfolio Sharpe = 1.2 / 0.515 = 2.33 (excellent!). This demonstrates the power of diversification in stat arb-50 pairs with 0.25 correlation nearly doubles Sharpe. **(b) Annual turnover**: Half-life 8 days means typical holding period ~12-15 days (allowing for reversion time). Assuming 15 days average: Annual turnover = 252 trading days / 15 days = 16.8 round-trips per pair. Total portfolio turnover = 16.8 × 50 pairs = 840 round-trips, or 1,680% annually (gross). **(c) Transaction cost impact**: Cost per round-trip = 15 bps. Annual cost = 16.8 round-trips × 15 bps = 252 bps = 2.52% of capital. If gross return is 12% (Sharpe 1.2 × 10% vol), net return = 12% - 2.52% = 9.48% (net Sharpe = 9.48/10 = 0.95, still acceptable but significantly reduced from 2.33 gross). **(d) Capacity constraints**: Stat arb strategies face capacity limits due to: (1) Market impact: Larger positions move prices before profit realized. Using Almgren-Chriss, impact scales as √(Q/V). If current positions are 0.1% of daily volume (negligible impact), scaling to 10× AUM (\$1B) increases impact to 1% ADV → impact = √10 × current = 3.16× higher. This could consume 50-100 bps of return. (2) Spread compression: As more capital chases same pairs, entry thresholds narrow (spreads stop reaching 2σ because other traders enter at 1.8σ). This reduces trade frequency and profitability. **Breakeven calculation**: Strategy becomes unprofitable when transaction costs + market impact exceed gross return. Currently: Gross return = 12%, costs = 2.5%, impact = negligible. At 10× AUM: Impact increases to ~1.5%, costs remain 2.5%, total = 4%, leaving 8% net (still profitable). At 20× AUM: Impact ~3%, costs 2.5%, total = 5.5%, leaving 6.5% net (marginal). At 30× AUM: Impact ~4.5%, costs 2.5%, total = 7%, leaving 5% net. **Estimated capacity**: $2-3B before strategy breaks even, considering pairs become overcrowded and cointegration weakens as AUM grows.`,

      question:
        'During the 2008 financial crisis, many pairs trading strategies suffered catastrophic losses despite backtests showing strong performance. For example, JPM-BAC (both banks, historically cointegrated p<0.01) spread widened to 6σ and never reverted (Lehman bankruptcy caused regime change). Design a comprehensive risk management framework for a pairs trading strategy that would have protected against 2008-style losses. Address: correlation risk, regime detection, stop-loss rules, sector concentration, and portfolio-level risk controls.',
      sampleAnswer: `**Comprehensive risk management framework for pairs trading (2008-proof):** **(1) Correlation risk monitoring**: Track rolling 60-day correlation between pairs. If correlation drops below 0.5 (from historical 0.7+), reduce position size by 50%. If correlation turns negative, exit immediately. Example: JPM-BAC correlation went from 0.8 → 0.3 → -0.2 during crisis (as JPM benefited from flight-to-quality while BAC faced insolvency). Early correlation break detection would trigger exit before catastrophic spread widening. **(2) Regime detection (cointegration stability)**: Re-test cointegration monthly using rolling 250-day window. If p-value rises above 0.10 (from <0.05), flag pair for potential exit. If p-value >0.20, force exit (cointegration broke). Also monitor half-life: if half-life doubles (8 days → 16 days), it signals slower reversion (potential regime change). Example: BAC-JPM half-life went from 10 days to 45 days in Aug-Sep 2008 (warning signal). **(3) Dynamic stop-losses**: Traditional 4σ stops are too wide (catastrophic loss). Implement: (a) Initial stop: 3σ (tighter than standard 4σ), (b) Time-based stop: If position held >30 days (2× half-life) without reversion, exit (mean reversion failed), (c) Volatility-adjusted stop: If VIX >30, tighten stops to 2.5σ (crisis mode-pairs decorrelate), (d) Drawdown-based stop: If pair loses >3% of allocated capital, exit (multiple 3% losses can compound to portfolio wipeout). Example: With 3σ stop on JPM-BAC at σ=$2, exit at spread=$6 (vs traditional 4σ = $8, saving 33% of loss). **(4) Sector concentration limits**: Limit exposure to any single sector (e.g., financials) to 30% of portfolio. During 2008, financial pairs all moved together (correlation spiked to 0.8+), eliminating diversification. By capping sector exposure, you prevent correlated blow-ups. Example: With 50 pairs and 30% financials limit, max 15 financial pairs. If financial sector suffers, max loss = 30% × portfolio, not 100%. **(5) Portfolio-level risk controls**: (a) VIX trigger: If VIX >35, reduce portfolio leverage from 1× to 0.5× (or exit entirely). VIX >35 signals regime change where mean reversion strategies fail. (b) Max portfolio drawdown: If portfolio down >10%, reduce all positions by 50%. If down >15%, exit all positions (protect capital for recovery). (c) Diversification requirement: Maintain ≥30 pairs across ≥6 sectors. Single-pair risk capped at 3% of capital. (d) Liquidity requirements: All pairs must have >$50M average daily volume (ensures ability to exit quickly). **Backtesting the framework**: Simulating 2008 with these rules: (a) Correlation break in July → reduce JPM-BAC position 50%, (b) VIX >35 in September → reduce portfolio 50%, (c) Drawdown >10% in October → reduce portfolio another 50% (net 25% exposure), (d) Result: Max drawdown -15% (vs -40% without controls). **Key insight**: Stat arb assumes stationary relationships (cointegration), but crises create regime changes. Risk management must detect and respond to non-stationarity (correlation breaks, cointegration failure, volatility spikes) to survive tail events.`,
