    question:
      'You are constructing an optimal portfolio from 5 assets with the following characteristics: Asset A (E[R]=12%, σ=20%), Asset B (E[R]=10%, σ=15%), Asset C (E[R]=8%, σ=10%), Asset D (E[R]=6%, σ=8%), Asset E (E[R]=15%, σ=30%). Correlation matrix shows A-B=0.7, A-C=0.3, B-C=0.5, all others=0.2. Using mean-variance optimization: (1) Explain the efficient frontier construction process, (2) Calculate approximate minimum variance portfolio composition, (3) Determine maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio (Rf=3%), (4) Analyze diversification benefits vs single-asset investing, (5) Discuss limitations when correlations spike during crises.',
    sampleAnswer: `Mean-variance optimization comprehensive analysis: (1) EFFICIENT FRONTIER CONSTRUCTION: Process: (a) Define optimization problem: Minimize portfolio variance σ²_p = w^T Σ w subject to w^T μ = target return and Σw_i = 1. (b) Create covariance matrix Σ from individual volatilities and correlations. Example: Cov(A,B) = ρ_AB × σ_A × σ_B = 0.7 × 0.20 × 0.15 = 0.021. (c) For each target return (6% to 15%), solve quadratic program to find minimum variance portfolio. (d) Plot resulting (σ_p, R_p) points to form efficient frontier curve. (e) Identify key portfolios: minimum variance (leftmost point), maximum Sharpe (tangency with Capital Market Line). Mathematical: Using Lagrangian multipliers, solve: ∂/∂w [w^T Σ w + λ_1(w^T μ - R_target) + λ_2(w^T 1 - 1)] = 0. Result: Efficient frontier is hyperbola in (σ, R) space. (2) MINIMUM VARIANCE PORTFOLIO: Objective: Minimize σ²_p with no return constraint. Analytical solution: w_mv = (Σ^(-1) × 1) / (1^T × Σ^(-1) × 1). Intuition: Weight inversely to variance, adjusted for correlations. Approximate calculation: Asset C (σ=10%) and D (σ=8%) have lowest volatility. If uncorrelated, optimal weights ∝ 1/σ². Weight C: (1/0.10²) / [(1/0.10²) + (1/0.08²)] = 100 / (100 + 156.25) = 39%. Weight D: 156.25 / 256.25 = 61%. But correlation C-D = 0.2 increases combined variance. Adjusted: More weight to D (lower σ). Estimated min-var portfolio: D: 55%, C: 30%, B: 10%, A: 5%, E: 0% (too volatile). Expected return: 0.55×6% + 0.30×8% + 0.10×10% + 0.05×12% = 7.5%. Volatility: With correlations, approximately σ_p ≈ 7.5-8% (below any single asset). Sharpe: (7.5% - 3%) / 8% = 0.56. (3) MAXIMUM SHARPE RATIO PORTFOLIO: Objective: Maximize (R_p - R_f) / σ_p. Analytical solution: w_maxSR ∝ Σ^(-1) × (μ - R_f × 1). This is tangency portfolio where CML touches efficient frontier. Calculation approach: For each frontier portfolio, calculate Sharpe ratio. Max Sharpe occurs at tangency. Estimated composition: Need higher return assets with low correlation. Asset E has highest return (15%) but highest volatility (30%). Asset A has good return (12%) with moderate correlation. Rough estimate: A: 30%, B: 25%, C: 20%, E: 20%, D: 5%. Expected return: 0.30×12% + 0.25×10% + 0.20×8% + 0.20×15% + 0.05×6% = 10.9%. Volatility: With correlations, approximately σ_p ≈ 14% (diversification reduces from weighted average ~17%). Sharpe: (10.9% - 3%) / 14% = 0.56 (much higher than individual assets). Best individual: Asset A Sharpe = (12%-3%)/20% = 0.45. Max Sharpe portfolio beats all individuals by 24%. (4) DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS: Single-asset investing: Asset E: R=15%, σ=30%, Sharpe=0.40. Attractive return but high risk. Asset D: R=6%, σ=8%, Sharpe=0.375. Safe but low return. Diversified portfolio (Max Sharpe): R=10.9%, σ=14%, Sharpe=0.56. Quantifying benefits: Risk reduction: σ drops from 30% (Asset E alone) to 14% (portfolio) = 53% risk reduction. Return sacrifice: Only 4.1% (from 15% to 10.9%) = 27% return reduction. Risk-adjusted gain: Sharpe increases 40% (from 0.40 to 0.56). Correlation effect: If all assets perfectly correlated (ρ=1), portfolio σ = weighted average = 17%. Actual σ = 14% < 17% due to imperfect correlation. Diversification benefit: 14%/17% = 82% of undiversified risk (18% reduction from correlation). Efficient frontier dominance: For σ=14%, single asset might give R=8-9%. Efficient frontier gives R=10.9% at same risk. Alpha = 2-3% from diversification. (5) LIMITATIONS DURING CRISES: Correlation spike: In 2008 crisis, correlations → 0.9-0.95 (from 0.3-0.5 normal). All assets moved together, destroying diversification. Example: Portfolio with ρ=0.3 normally has σ_p=14%. In crisis with ρ=0.9, σ_p→22% (57% increase). Contagion effect: "When you need diversification most, it disappears." Static covariance assumption: MPT uses historical Σ, but correlations change. Crisis regime completely different from normal regime. Solutions: (a) Tail risk hedging: Hold uncorrelated assets (gold, long-term bonds, VIX calls). Gold correlation = -0.2 normally, stays negative in crises. (b) Dynamic allocation: Reduce equity exposure when volatility spikes. Tactical shift to bonds/cash in high-stress periods. (c) Robust optimization: Use worst-case covariance matrices. Assume correlations can go to 0.8-0.9 in stress. (d) Risk parity: Allocate based on risk contribution, not return. Ensures no single asset dominates risk in crisis. Practical example: 2020 COVID crash: SPY down 34% in 30 days. Portfolio with 60% equity, 40% bonds down 20% (bonds helped). Pure equity down 34%. Diversification saved 14% drawdown. But correlation spiked: Bonds ρ with equity = 0.1 normally → 0.5 during crash (less protection than expected).`,
