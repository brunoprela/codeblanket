      question:
        'A pension fund has a liability of $500M due in 15 years. The fund manager proposes two strategies: Strategy A: Buy $500M face value of 15-year zero-coupon Treasury bonds currently priced at $400M (YTM 4.2%). Strategy B: Buy a portfolio of 10-year (duration 8.5) and 20-year (duration 14.5) coupon bonds weighted to achieve 15-year duration, total investment $420M. Current rates: 10Y at 4.0%, 20Y at 4.5%. (1) Calculate the exact portfolio weights for Strategy B to match 15-year duration, (2) Compare interest rate risk if rates rise 1% uniformly (parallel shift), (3) Analyze convexity differences and impact on hedging effectiveness, (4) Evaluate reinvestment risk for each strategy, (5) Recommend optimal strategy considering transaction costs, rebalancing needs, and basis risk.',
      sampleAnswer:
        "Duration matching analysis: (1) PORTFOLIO WEIGHTS FOR STRATEGY B: Target: Duration = 15 years using 10Y (D=8.5) and 20Y (D=14.5) bonds. Formula: Portfolio Duration = w_10Y × D_10Y + w_20Y × D_20Y. Constraint: w_10Y + w_20Y = 1 (fully invested). Substituting: 15 = w_10Y × 8.5 + (1 - w_10Y) × 14.5. 15 = 8.5 w_10Y + 14.5 - 14.5 w_10Y. 15 = 14.5 - 6.0 w_10Y. 6.0 w_10Y = 14.5 - 15 = -0.5. w_10Y = -0.5 / 6.0 = -0.0833 (NEGATIVE!). w_20Y = 1 - (-0.0833) = 1.0833 (> 100%!). INTERPRETATION: Cannot achieve 15-year duration with only 10Y and 20Y bonds without SHORTING! Need to SHORT 8.33% of 10Y bonds and go LONG 108.33% of 20Y bonds. Why? Both bonds have durations BELOW and ABOVE 15, so need leverage. Alternative approach: Use only long positions (no shorting). This means accepting duration mismatch OR adding a third bond. If constrained to long-only: Best approximation: 100% in 20Y bonds → Duration 14.5 (close to 15). Or: Add 5Y bonds (D ≈ 4.5) to mix with 20Y. Let's solve with 5Y and 20Y: 15 = w_5Y × 4.5 + w_20Y × 14.5, w_5Y + w_20Y = 1. 15 = 4.5 w_5Y + 14.5 (1 - w_5Y). 15 = 4.5 w_5Y + 14.5 - 14.5 w_5Y. 15 = 14.5 - 10.0 w_5Y. 10.0 w_5Y = -0.5. w_5Y = -0.05 (still negative!). Issue: 15 > 14.5 (longest available duration). Need bonds LONGER than 20Y, or use leverage. SOLUTION: Use 30Y bonds (assume D ≈ 18). 15 = w_10Y × 8.5 + w_30Y × 18, w_10Y + w_30Y = 1. 15 = 8.5 w_10Y + 18 (1 - w_10Y). 15 = 8.5 w_10Y + 18 - 18 w_10Y. 15 = 18 - 9.5 w_10Y. 9.5 w_10Y = 3. w_10Y = 3 / 9.5 = 0.316 (31.6%). w_30Y = 1 - 0.316 = 0.684 (68.4%). FINAL WEIGHTS: 31.6% in 10Y bonds, 68.4% in 30Y bonds (assuming 30Y has D=18). Investment: $420M total. 10Y allocation: 0.316 × $420M = $132.7M. 30Y allocation: 0.684 × $420M = $287.3M. CHECK: Duration = 0.316 × 8.5 + 0.684 × 18 = 2.69 + 12.31 = 15.0 ✓. (2) INTEREST RATE RISK IF RATES RISE 1%: STRATEGY A (15Y Zero-Coupon): Modified Duration: D_mod = Macaulay Duration / (1 + y) = 15 / 1.042 ≈ 14.39. Price change: ΔP/P ≈ -D_mod × Δy = -14.39 × 0.01 = -0.1439 = -14.39%. Initial investment: $400M. Loss: $400M × 14.39% = $57.6M. New value: $400M - $57.6M = $342.4M. STRATEGY B (10Y + 30Y Portfolio): Portfolio duration: 15 (by construction). Portfolio modified duration ≈ 15 / 1.042 ≈ 14.39 (same as Strategy A!). Price change: -14.39%. Initial investment: $420M. Loss: $420M × 14.39% = $60.4M. New value: $420M - $60.4M = $359.6M. COMPARISON: Strategy A loses $57.6M (14.39% of $400M). Strategy B loses $60.4M (14.39% of $420M). Strategy B loses MORE in dollar terms because higher initial investment ($420M vs $400M). But percentage loss is SAME (14.39%) because durations matched. KEY INSIGHT: Duration matching ensures EQUAL PERCENTAGE losses for parallel shifts. Dollar losses differ due to initial investment size. (3) CONVEXITY DIFFERENCES: STRATEGY A (Zero-Coupon Bond): Zero-coupon bonds have HIGHEST convexity for given duration. Convexity ≈ Duration² / (1 + y) ≈ 15² / 1.042 ≈ 216. STRATEGY B (Coupon Bond Portfolio): Coupon bonds have LOWER convexity than zero-coupon. 10Y bond: Convexity ≈ 80. 30Y bond: Convexity ≈ 300. Portfolio convexity: C_p = w_10Y × C_10Y + w_30Y × C_30Y = 0.316 × 80 + 0.684 × 300 = 25.3 + 205.2 = 230.5. COMPARISON: Strategy A convexity: 216. Strategy B convexity: 230.5 (HIGHER!). Why B higher? Barbell strategy (short + long durations) has higher convexity than bullet (single maturity). IMPACT ON HEDGING: Higher convexity = BETTER hedging (convexity is always beneficial). For 1% rate change: Duration effect: Both strategies -14.39%. Convexity correction: Strategy A: +0.5 × 216 × (0.01)² = +0.0108 = +1.08%. Strategy B: +0.5 × 230.5 × (0.01)² = +0.0115 = +1.15%. Total price change: Strategy A: -14.39% + 1.08% = -13.31% → Loss $53.2M (vs $57.6M duration-only). Strategy B: -14.39% + 1.15% = -13.24% → Loss $55.6M (vs $60.4M duration-only). Strategy B benefits MORE from convexity (loses $2.9M less than duration estimate). CONCLUSION: Strategy B's higher convexity provides better protection (smaller losses for large rate moves). (4) REINVESTMENT RISK: STRATEGY A (Zero-Coupon): NO reinvestment risk! Zero-coupon pays nothing until maturity → no coupons to reinvest. Initial investment: $400M. At maturity (15Y): Receive $500M (locked in, guaranteed). Return: ($500M / $400M)^(1/15) - 1 = 1.25^(1/15) - 1 = 1.0149 - 1 = 1.49% annually... wait, that's wrong. YTM 4.2% given. $400M grows to $500M at 4.2%: $400M × (1.042)^15 = $400M × 1.84 = $736M (not $500M!). Issue: Face value $500M doesn't match. Let me recalculate price: If face value $500M, YTM 4.2%, 15 years: Price = $500M / (1.042)^15 = $500M / 1.84 = $271.7M (not $400M). There's inconsistency in problem statement. Assuming price $400M is correct for $500M face value: Implied YTM: ($500M / $400M)^(1/15) - 1 = 1.25^(1/15) - 1 = 0.0149 = 1.49% (very low!). This seems unrealistic. Let's assume $400M buys bonds with $740M face value at 4.2% YTM: $400M = $740M / (1.042)^15 → checks out. At maturity: Receive $740M (no reinvestment risk). Return: Locked 4.2% annually. STRATEGY B (Coupon Bond Portfolio): SIGNIFICANT reinvestment risk! 10Y bond matures in 10 years → need to reinvest proceeds for 5 more years. 30Y bond pays coupons annually → must reinvest coupons for 15 years. Example: 30Y bond with 4.5% coupon on $287.3M: Annual coupon: $287.3M × 4.5% = $12.9M. Must reinvest $12.9M annually for 15 years. If rates fall (e.g., to 3%), reinvestment return lower → final value below target. If rates rise (e.g., to 5%), reinvestment return higher → final value above target. 10Y bond: Matures in 10Y, must reinvest $132.7M principal + accumulated coupons for 5 years. Rate uncertainty for years 10-15 creates risk. RISK QUANTIFICATION: Assume rates fall to 3% after purchase: Coupons reinvested at 3% (vs expected 4.5%) → shortfall. Estimate: $12.9M × 15 years = $193.5M coupons. At 4.5%: FV = $193.5M × annuity factor ≈ $300M. At 3.0%: FV ≈ $260M. Shortfall: $40M (13% of coupons). CONCLUSION: Strategy A has NO reinvestment risk (massive advantage for liability matching). Strategy B has HIGH reinvestment risk (could underfund liability if rates fall). (5) OPTIMAL STRATEGY RECOMMENDATION: COMPARISON SUMMARY: | Criterion | Strategy A (Zero) | Strategy B (Coupon) | Winner |. | Initial Cost | $400M | $420M | A (cheaper) |. | Duration Match | 15 years (perfect) | 15 years (perfect) | TIE |. | Convexity | 216 (lower) | 230.5 (higher) | B (better) |. | Reinvestment Risk | ZERO | HIGH | A (critical) |. | Rebalancing | None needed | Frequent (duration drift) | A (simpler) |. | Liquidity | Lower (zeros less liquid) | Higher (coupons more liquid) | B |. | Transaction Costs | One-time purchase | Multiple bonds + rebalancing | A (lower) |. TRANSACTION COSTS: Strategy A: Buy once, hold to maturity. Cost: 0.05-0.10% (5-10 bps) one-time. Total: $400M × 0.10% = $400k. Strategy B: Initial purchase: 2 bonds × 10 bps = $840k. Rebalancing: Quarterly for 15 years = 60 rebalances. Cost per rebalance: 0.05% × $420M = $210k. Total rebalancing: 60 × $210k = $12.6M (huge!). But likely only rebalance when duration drifts >0.5 years → maybe 10 times. Cost: 10 × $210k = $2.1M. Total: $840k + $2.1M = $2.94M (vs $400k for A). Strategy B costs $2.5M more in transactions. REBALANCING NEEDS: Strategy A: Duration stays 15 years (declines by 1 year annually as time passes). No rebalancing needed (buy-and-hold). Strategy B: Duration drifts as: Time passes (duration declines), Yield curve shifts (non-parallel moves), Bonds age (convexity changes). Must rebalance every 6-12 months → operational complexity. Example: After 2 years, 10Y bond becomes 8Y (D ≈ 7.5), 30Y becomes 28Y (D ≈ 17.5). New portfolio duration: 0.316 × 7.5 + 0.684 × 17.5 = 14.3 (below 15!). Must adjust: Sell some 8Y, buy more 28Y (or buy new 30Y). Cost + time + risk. BASIS RISK: Strategy A: No basis risk. Zero-coupon perfectly matches liability (both zero-coupon structure). Strategy B: Basis risk from: Coupon payments (liability is lump sum, portfolio has cash flows). Maturity mismatch (10Y and 30Y vs 15Y liability). Yield curve risk (if curve steepens/flattens unevenly, hedge fails). Example: If 10Y-30Y spread widens (curve steepens), portfolio duration changes even without rate level change. RECOMMENDATION: **Choose Strategy A (15Y Zero-Coupon Bonds)** RATIONALE: Perfect liability match: Zero-coupon structure matches lump-sum liability exactly. No reinvestment risk: Guaranteed $500M at maturity (or $740M if scaled). Lower cost: $400M vs $420M (saves $20M upfront). Transaction costs: $400k vs $3M (saves $2.6M). No rebalancing: Buy-and-hold (operational simplicity, lower risk). No basis risk: Bullet strategy eliminates curve risk. Drawback: Lower convexity (216 vs 230), but this is minor (1.08% vs 1.15% benefit). Drawback: Lower liquidity (zeros trade less), but pension fund is buy-and-hold investor (doesn't matter). FINAL ANSWER: Strategy A is superior for pension liability matching. Only choose Strategy B if: Zeros unavailable (market liquidity constraints), or Manager wants to actively manage duration (tactical bets), or Regulatory restrictions on zeros (some jurisdictions limit zero holdings). For passive liability-driven investing, Strategy A (zero-coupon) is textbook optimal solution.",

      question:
        'You observe the following Treasury yields: 1Y: 3.5%, 2Y: 4.0%, 3Y: 4.3%, 5Y: 4.6%, 10Y: 4.8%, 30Y: 5.0%. The yield curve is upward sloping but flattening (10Y-2Y spread = 80 bps, historically 10Y-2Y averages 150 bps). You are considering three fixed income strategies: (1) Carry Trade: Borrow 2Y at 4.0%, invest 10Y at 4.8% (positive carry 80 bps), (2) Curve Steepener: Long 10Y bonds, short 2Y bonds (duration-neutral), betting curve steepens back to 150 bps, (3) Bullet Strategy: Buy 5Y bonds, hold to maturity. For each strategy: (A) Calculate expected return/PnL assuming: (i) Rates unchanged, (ii) Parallel shift up 1%, (iii) Curve steepens (2Y +0.5%, 10Y unchanged), (B) Analyze breakeven scenarios, (C) Identify key risks, (D) Recommend optimal strategy given Fed is expected to cut rates in 12 months (priced in market already).',
      sampleAnswer:
        "Yield curve strategies analysis: GIVEN DATA: 1Y: 3.5%, 2Y: 4.0%, 3Y: 4.3%, 5Y: 4.6%, 10Y: 4.8%, 30Y: 5.0%. Current spread (10Y-2Y): 80 bps. Historical average: 150 bps (curve flatter than usual). Assumption: Duration 2Y ≈ 1.9, 5Y ≈ 4.5, 10Y ≈ 8.5 (for 4.8% coupon bonds). STRATEGY 1: CARRY TRADE (A) EXPECTED RETURNS: Setup: Borrow $100M at 2Y rate (4.0%), invest $100M in 10Y bonds (4.8%). Positive carry: 4.8% - 4.0% = 0.80% annually = 80 bps. (i) RATES UNCHANGED (1 year holding period): Income: Earn 10Y coupon: $100M × 4.8% = $4.8M. Pay 2Y borrowing: $100M × 4.0% = $4.0M. Net carry: $4.8M - $4.0M = $800k (0.80%). Roll-down gain: 10Y bond becomes 9Y after 1 year. If curve unchanged, 9Y yield ≈ 4.75% (interpolate between 5Y at 4.6% and 10Y at 4.8%). Price change: Δy = 4.75% - 4.8% = -0.05% (yield falls as bond rolls down curve). Price gain: -D_mod × Δy = -8.5 × (-0.0005) = 0.425% = $425k. Total return: $800k (carry) + $425k (roll-down) = $1.225M = 1.225%. (ii) PARALLEL SHIFT UP 1%: Carry: $800k (same). Capital loss on 10Y: ΔP/P = -8.5 × 0.01 = -8.5% = -$8.5M. Capital gain on 2Y short: ΔP/P = -1.9 × 0.01 = -1.9%, but we're SHORT → gain +1.9% = +$1.9M. Net: $800k + (-$8.5M) + $1.9M = -$5.8M = -5.8% (large loss!). (iii) CURVE STEEPENS (2Y +0.5%, 10Y unchanged): Carry: $800k. 10Y: No yield change → no capital loss (0%). 2Y: Yield rises 0.5% → price falls. Short 2Y gains: -D_2Y × Δy = -1.9 × 0.005 = -0.95%, but SHORT → +0.95% = +$950k. Net: $800k + 0 + $950k = $1.75M = 1.75% (great!). (B) BREAKEVEN: Question: How much can 10Y yield rise before we break even (0% return)? Carry = $800k. If 10Y yield rises by x%: Capital loss = -8.5% × x = -8.5x. Short 2Y gain = +1.9% × x (if parallel) = +1.9x. Net: $800k - 8.5x + 1.9x = 0. $800k = 6.6x. x = $800k / 6.6M = 0.121% = 12.1 bps. Breakeven: 10Y yield can rise 12.1 bps before carry trade loses money. If 10Y goes from 4.8% to 4.921%, break even. RISK: Current 10Y at 4.8%. If Fed hikes or sells bonds, 10Y could easily rise 50-100 bps → massive losses. (C) KEY RISKS: Interest rate risk: Duration mismatch (long 10Y D=8.5, short 2Y D=1.9) → net duration +6.6. Exposed to rate rises. Refinancing risk: 2Y borrowing matures in 2 years → must roll at potentially higher rate. If 2Y yield rises to 5% in 2Y, carry becomes negative (4.8% - 5% = -0.2%). Curve flattening: If 10Y-2Y spread narrows (e.g., 10Y rises or 2Y falls more), carry compresses. Leverage risk: Borrowing $100M requires margin, potential margin calls if losing. STRATEGY 2: CURVE STEEPENER (A) EXPECTED RETURNS: Setup: Long $100M 10Y bonds (D=8.5), Short $X of 2Y bonds (D=1.9) such that net duration = 0 (duration-neutral). Duration-neutral condition: $100M × 8.5 = $X × 1.9 → X = $447.4M. SHORT $447.4M of 2Y bonds to neutralize duration. (i) RATES UNCHANGED: Carry: Long 10Y earns 4.8% on $100M = $4.8M. Short 2Y pays 4.0% on $447.4M = $17.9M. Net carry: $4.8M - $17.9M = -$13.1M (negative carry!). Roll-down: Long 10Y: Becomes 9Y, yield falls 0.05%, gain ≈ $425k (as before). Short 2Y: Becomes 1Y, yield falls from 4.0% to 3.5% (down 0.5%), loss on short. Short 2Y price change: -1.9 × (-0.005) = +0.95%, but we're short → loss -0.95% × $447.4M = -$4.25M. Net: -$13.1M + $425k - $4.25M = -$16.9M = -16.9% (huge bleed!). DURATION-NEUTRAL ≠ POSITIVE CARRY. This is \"negative carry\" trade (pays to hold). (ii) PARALLEL SHIFT UP 1%: By construction, duration-neutral → no P&L from parallel shifts (0%). Carry: -$13.1M (as above). Total: -$13.1M = -13.1% (loses carry even if rates unchanged). (iii) CURVE STEEPENS (2Y +0.5%, 10Y unchanged): Long 10Y: No change (0%). Short 2Y: Yield rises 0.5% → price falls -1.9 × 0.005 = -0.95%. Short position gains: +0.95% × $447.4M = $4.25M. Net: -$13.1M (carry) + $4.25M (steepening) = -$8.85M = -8.85% (still loss!). Need LARGER steepening to offset negative carry. (B) BREAKEVEN: How much must curve steepen to break even? Need: Steepening gain = Carry cost. If 2Y yield rises by Δy (10Y unchanged): Short 2Y gain = 1.9 × Δy × $447.4M = 8.5M × Δy. Carry cost = -$13.1M. Breakeven: 8.5M × Δy = $13.1M → Δy = 1.54% = 154 bps. Curve must steepen by 154 bps for break even! Current spread: 80 bps. Need spread to widen to 80 + 154 = 234 bps (from 80 bps). Massive move required. Historical average: 150 bps → only 70 bps steepening expected. Steepener trade is EXPENSIVE (negative carry kills it). (C) KEY RISKS: Negative carry: Bleeds -13.1% annually even if rates unchanged (very painful). Curve flattens further: If 10Y rises or 2Y falls, losses accelerate. Leverage: Short $447.4M requires 4.5× leverage (risky). Timing: Even if curve eventually steepens, negative carry could wipe out over months/years. STRATEGY 3: BULLET (5Y BONDS) (A) EXPECTED RETURNS: Setup: Buy $100M 5Y bonds at 4.6% yield (D ≈ 4.5). (i) RATES UNCHANGED: Carry: $100M × 4.6% = $4.6M. Roll-down: 5Y becomes 4Y. Assume 4Y yield ≈ 4.45% (interpolate between 3Y at 4.3% and 5Y at 4.6%). Yield change: 4.45% - 4.6% = -0.15%. Price gain: -4.5 × (-0.0015) = 0.675% = $675k. Total: $4.6M + $675k = $5.275M = 5.275%. (ii) PARALLEL SHIFT UP 1%: Carry: $4.6M. Capital loss: -4.5 × 0.01 = -4.5% = -$4.5M. Net: $4.6M - $4.5M = $100k = 0.10% (nearly break even!). (iii) CURVE STEEPENS (2Y +0.5%, 10Y unchanged): Assume 5Y yield rises proportionally: e.g., +0.25% (midpoint between 2Y +0.5% and 10Y 0%). Carry: $4.6M. Capital loss: -4.5 × 0.0025 = -1.125% = -$1.125M. Net: $4.6M - $1.125M = $3.475M = 3.475%. (B) BREAKEVEN: How much can 5Y yield rise? Carry = $4.6M. Loss = -4.5 × Δy × $100M. Breakeven: $4.6M = 4.5 × Δy × $100M. Δy = $4.6M / ($4.5M / 0.01) = 1.02% = 102 bps. 5Y yield can rise 102 bps before loss. Current 5Y at 4.6% → can tolerate up to 5.62% (very safe!). (C) KEY RISKS: Interest rate risk: Moderate (D=4.5, mid-range). Opportunity cost: If rates rise sharply, could have earned more staying short-term or in cash. Reinvestment risk: At maturity (5Y), must reinvest at prevailing rates (unknown). COMPARISON TABLE: | Strategy | Rates Unch | +1% Parallel | Steepening | Carry | Breakeven | Key Risk |. | Carry Trade | +1.225% | -5.8% | +1.75% | +0.80% | 12 bps | Duration mismatch |. | Steepener | -16.9% | -13.1% | -8.85% | -13.1% | 154 bps | Negative carry |. | Bullet (5Y) | +5.275% | +0.10% | +3.475% | +4.6% | 102 bps | Moderate duration |. (D) OPTIMAL STRATEGY GIVEN FED EXPECTED TO CUT RATES: MARKET CONTEXT: Fed expected to cut rates in 12 months (already priced in). Implication: Current curve reflects rate cut expectations (short rates expected to fall). If priced in, yields may not fall further (limited upside from rate cuts). Risk: If Fed DOESN'T cut (inflation sticky), rates could rise (surprise). ANALYSIS BY STRATEGY: CARRY TRADE: Pros: If rates unchanged or fall, positive carry + roll-down = 1.2-2%. Cons: If Fed raises (surprise) or sells bonds, 10Y yield rises → large losses (-5.8% for 1% rise). Priced-in cuts: Already in curve (limited further benefit). Verdict: Risky. Negative asymmetry (small gains, large losses). CURVE STEEPENER: Pros: If Fed cuts aggressively (more than priced), short rates fall more than long → steepening. Cons: Negative carry (-13.1%) bleeds value. Need 154 bps steepening to break even (unlikely in 12 months). Even if curve steepens 70 bps (to historical 150 bps), still lose -8.85%. Verdict: BAD. Negative carry makes it unviable unless extreme steepening (low probability). BULLET (5Y): Pros: Positive carry (4.6%), moderate duration (4.5) → balanced risk/reward. If rates fall (cuts happen), gains 4.5% × 1% = +4.5% capital gain + 4.6% carry = +9%. If rates rise (cuts don't happen), loses only 4.5% - 4.6% carry ≈ 0% (protected by carry). Breakeven: 102 bps (very wide cushion). Cons: Lower upside than carry trade if rates fall significantly. Verdict: BEST. Balanced, positive carry, wide breakeven, moderate risk. RECOMMENDATION: **STRATEGY 3: BULLET (5Y BONDS)** RATIONALE: Positive carry: 4.6% income provides cushion. Wide breakeven: Can tolerate 102 bps rate rise (highly unlikely). Balanced duration: 4.5 provides upside if cuts happen (+9% if rates -1%), limited downside if cuts don't (+0% if rates +1%). No leverage: No margin risk, no refinancing risk. No timing risk: Works over 12-month horizon regardless of when cuts occur. Risk management: Fed cuts priced in → limited incremental benefit from cuts, but limited downside if status quo. Alternative: If conviction that Fed will cut MORE than priced (e.g., 3 cuts vs 1 priced), consider carry trade (leveraged bet on rate decline). But given uncertainty, bullet strategy is prudent base case. FINAL ANSWER: Bullet (5Y) for core portfolio (80% allocation). Small carry trade position (20%) if conviction on rate cuts.

      question:
        'A corporate bond portfolio manager holds $50M in BBB-rated 5-year bonds from Company XYZ, currently trading at par (100) with 5% coupon, YTM 5.0%, duration 4.3. Credit spreads: BBB = 150 bps over Treasuries (5Y Treasury at 3.5%). You receive credit research suggesting XYZ may be downgraded to BB (high yield) in 6 months due to deteriorating fundamentals. Historical data: BBB→BB downgrades cause spread widening from 150 bps to 400 bps (average), and price impacts of -10% to -15%. You consider three risk management approaches: (1) Sell immediately at current price (100), lock in par value, (2) Buy 5Y credit default swap (CDS) protection at 180 bps annually, (3) Sell 30% of position now, buy CDS on remaining 70%. (A) Calculate expected PnL for each strategy under scenarios: (i) No downgrade (spreads tighten to 120 bps), (ii) Downgrade occurs (spreads widen to 400 bps), (iii) Default occurs (recovery rate 40%). (B) Determine breakeven CDS cost, (C) Analyze optimal hedge ratio, (D) Recommend strategy considering: (i) 60% probability of downgrade, (ii) 5% probability of default, (iii) Transaction costs 0.2% for bond sales, (iv) Opportunity cost if wrong (spreads tighten).',
      sampleAnswer:
        "Credit risk management analysis: GIVEN DATA: Position: $50M face value, BBB-rated 5Y bonds, 5% coupon, YTM 5.0%, Price 100 (par), Duration 4.3. Current spread: 150 bps (BBB spread over 3.5% Treasury). Downgrade risk: BBB → BB, spreads widen 150 bps → 400 bps (250 bps widening). Price impact: -10% to -15% (use -12.5% average). CDS cost: 180 bps annually (1.8% of notional). Probabilities: 60% downgrade, 5% default, 35% no downgrade (100% - 60% - 5%). Recovery rate: 40% (LGD = 60%). (A) EXPECTED PNL BY STRATEGY AND SCENARIO: STRATEGY 1: SELL IMMEDIATELY Sell $50M at par (100), receive $50M cash. Invest in Treasuries at 3.5% (risk-free). (i) NO DOWNGRADE (spreads tighten to 120 bps): Bond price would have risen. New yield: 3.5% + 120 bps = 4.7% (down from 5.0%). Price change: -D_mod × Δy = -4.3 × (-0.003) = +1.29% = +$645k. Forgone gain: $645k (opportunity cost). Actual PnL: $0 (sold at par, in cash). Relative to hold: -$645k. (ii) DOWNGRADE (spreads widen to 400 bps): Bond price falls 12.5% (as stated). Alternative calculation: New yield = 3.5% + 400 bps = 7.5% (up from 5.0%). Price change: -4.3 × 0.025 = -10.75% ≈ -$5.375M. Use -12.5% given: -$6.25M. Avoided loss: $6.25M (sold before downgrade!). Actual PnL: $0 (safe in cash). Relative to hold: +$6.25M. (iii) DEFAULT (recovery 40%): Bond worth 40% of face → $20M. Loss if held: $50M - $20M = -$30M. Avoided loss: $30M (sold before default!). Actual PnL: $0. Relative to hold: +$30M. STRATEGY 1 SUMMARY: No downgrade: -$645k (opportunity cost). Downgrade: +$6.25M (avoided loss). Default: +$30M (avoided loss). Expected PnL: 35% × (-$645k) + 60% × $6.25M + 5% × $30M = -$226k + $3.75M + $1.5M = $5.024M. STRATEGY 2: BUY CDS PROTECTION Pay 180 bps annually = 1.8% × $50M = $900k per year. Assume 1-year horizon (simplified; CDS typically 5Y term, but analyze 1Y for comparison). Total cost: $900k. (i) NO DOWNGRADE (spreads tighten to 120 bps): Bond gains: +$645k (as calculated). CDS cost: -$900k. Net: $645k - $900k = -$255k (loss from CDS premium). (ii) DOWNGRADE (spreads widen to 400 bps): Bond loss: -$6.25M. CDS protection: Does downgrade trigger CDS? No, CDS only pays on DEFAULT, not downgrade! CDS value increases (mark-to-market), but no payment. Assume CDS can be sold at higher value: New CDS spread for BB: 400 bps (vs paid 180 bps). CDS value gain: (400 - 180) bps × duration × notional ≈ 220 bps × 4.3 × $50M = 0.022 × 4.3 × $50M = $4.73M. Net: -$6.25M (bond loss) + $4.73M (CDS gain) - $900k (CDS cost) = -$2.42M. Still lose because CDS doesn't trigger on downgrade (only default). (iii) DEFAULT (recovery 40%): Bond loss: -$30M. CDS payoff: (100% - 40% recovery) × $50M = 60% × $50M = $30M. CDS cost: -$900k. Net: -$30M + $30M - $900k = -$900k (only lose CDS premium). STRATEGY 2 SUMMARY: No downgrade: -$255k. Downgrade: -$2.42M. Default: -$900k. Expected PnL: 35% × (-$255k) + 60% × (-$2.42M) + 5% × (-$900k) = -$89k - $1.45M - $45k = -$1.584M. WAIT, this is negative! Strategy 2 worse than doing nothing. Issue: CDS only protects DEFAULT, not downgrade. CDS is expensive (180 bps) relative to default probability (5%). STRATEGY 3: SELL 30%, BUY CDS ON 70% Sell: $50M × 30% = $15M at par (receive cash). CDS: 70% × $50M = $35M notional, cost 1.8% × $35M = $630k. (i) NO DOWNGRADE (spreads tighten to 120 bps): Gain on 70% held: 70% × $645k = $452k. CDS cost: -$630k. Net: $452k - $630k = -$178k. Transaction cost: 0.2% × $15M = $30k. Total: -$178k - $30k = -$208k. (ii) DOWNGRADE (spreads widen to 400 bps): Loss on 70% held: 70% × (-$6.25M) = -$4.375M. CDS mark-to-market gain: 70% × $4.73M = $3.31M. CDS cost: -$630k. Transaction cost: -$30k. Net: -$4.375M + $3.31M - $630k - $30k = -$1.725M. (iii) DEFAULT: Loss on 70% held: 70% × (-$30M) = -$21M. CDS payoff: 70% × $30M = $21M. CDS cost: -$630k. Transaction cost: -$30k. Net: -$21M + $21M - $630k - $30k = -$660k. STRATEGY 3 SUMMARY: No downgrade: -$208k. Downgrade: -$1.725M. Default: -$660k. Expected PnL: 35% × (-$208k) + 60% × (-$1.725M) + 5% × (-$660k) = -$73k - $1.035M - $33k = -$1.141M. COMPARISON OF STRATEGIES: | Strategy | No Downgrade | Downgrade | Default | Expected PnL |. | 1: Sell All | -$645k | +$6.25M | +$30M | +$5.024M |. | 2: CDS (100%) | -$255k | -$2.42M | -$900k | -$1.584M |. | 3: Sell 30%, CDS 70% | -$208k | -$1.725M | -$660k | -$1.141M |. | 4: Do Nothing | $0 / +$645k | -$6.25M | -$30M | ??? |. DO NOTHING (BASELINE): No downgrade: +$645k. Downgrade: -$6.25M. Default: -$30M. Expected: 35% × $645k + 60% × (-$6.25M) + 5% × (-$30M) = $226k - $3.75M - $1.5M = -$5.024M. WINNER: STRATEGY 1 (SELL ALL) Expected PnL: +$5.024M (best). Rationale: Avoids downgrade loss (-$6.25M) and default loss (-$30M). Opportunity cost of -$645k if no downgrade is small relative to downside protection. (B) BREAKEVEN CDS COST: Question: At what CDS cost does Strategy 2 equal Strategy 1? Strategy 1 expected PnL: +$5.024M. Strategy 2 PnL formula: No downgrade: Bond gain $645k - CDS cost. Downgrade: Bond loss -$6.25M + CDS MTM $4.73M - CDS cost = -$1.52M - CDS cost. Default: -$30M + $30M - CDS cost = -CDS cost. Expected: 35% × ($645k - CDS) + 60% × (-$1.52M - CDS) + 5% × (-CDS). = 35% × $645k + 60% × (-$1.52M) - CDS × (35% + 60% + 5%). = $226k - $912k - CDS. = -$686k - CDS. Set equal to Strategy 1: -$686k - CDS = +$5.024M. CDS = -$686k - $5.024M = -$5.71M. This is NEGATIVE, meaning CDS would need to PAY YOU to be equivalent to selling! Interpretation: CDS is not economically efficient for this scenario. Selling bonds dominates CDS because: Downgrade doesn't trigger CDS (only MTM gain). CDS premium (180 bps) too expensive relative to default probability (5%). Better breakeven question: At what default probability does CDS make sense? If default probability = p, expected CDS payoff = p × $30M. CDS cost = $900k. Breakeven: p × $30M = $900k → p = 3%. If default probability > 3%, CDS is worth buying (assuming premium 180 bps). Given actual default prob 5% > 3%, CDS slightly positive expected value. But accounting for downgrade scenario (60% prob), CDS still loses because no trigger. (C) OPTIMAL HEDGE RATIO: Question: What % to sell / hedge to maximize expected PnL? Let h = hedge ratio (% of position sold or hedged). If sell h × $50M: Retain (1-h) × $50M exposure. Sell proceeds: h × $50M (in cash at 3.5% Treasuries). Expected PnL formula: No downgrade: (1-h) × $645k (gain on retained bonds). Downgrade: (1-h) × (-$6.25M) (loss on retained). Default: (1-h) × (-$30M) (loss). Expected: (1-h) × [35% × $645k + 60% × (-$6.25M) + 5% × (-$30M)]. = (1-h) × [$226k - $3.75M - $1.5M]. = (1-h) × (-$5.024M). To maximize: Want (1-h) as SMALL as possible (minimize exposure to negative expectation). Optimal: h = 100% (sell everything). SENSITIVITY: If transaction costs very high (say 2% instead of 0.2%): Sell cost: 2% × $50M = $1M. Expected PnL: +$5.024M - $1M = +$4.024M (still positive). Even with high transaction costs, selling is optimal. (D) RECOMMENDATION: GIVEN: 60% downgrade probability (high!), 5% default probability, transaction cost 0.2%, opportunity cost if wrong (spreads tighten). DECISION FRAMEWORK: Base case: Expected PnL +$5.024M for selling (Strategy 1) vs -$5.024M for holding. This is $10M swing! Risk: 35% probability spreads tighten → lose $645k opportunity cost. Upside: 65% probability (downgrade or default) → save $6.25M or $30M. RECOMMENDATION: **STRATEGY 1: SELL IMMEDIATELY** RATIONALE: Highest expected value: +$5.024M (vs -$1.584M for CDS, -$1.141M for hybrid). Downside protection: Eliminates $6.25M downgrade loss and $30M default loss. Transaction cost: Only 0.2% × $50M = $100k (negligible). Simplicity: No ongoing CDS premium, no hedge maintenance. Opportunity cost: If no downgrade (35% prob), lose $645k (small relative to $6.25M saved). Risk-reward: Asymmetric payoff (lose small if wrong, win big if right). WHY NOT CDS? CDS only protects default (5% prob), not downgrade (60% prob). CDS premium (180 bps = $900k) expensive relative to benefit. Expected PnL negative (-$1.584M). WHY NOT PARTIAL HEDGE? Doesn't materially improve outcome (still lose -$1.141M expected). Complexity: Managing 70% position + CDS + monitoring. ALTERNATIVE: If manager has high conviction NO downgrade (contrarian vs research): Keep bonds, collect 5% coupon + spread compression (potential +$645k). But given 60% downgrade probability, this is reckless gambling. FINAL ANSWER: Sell all $50M bonds immediately. Take $100k transaction cost. Reinvest in safer bonds (A-rated or Treasuries). Expected benefit: $5M+ relative to holding. If credit research is wrong (no downgrade), lose $645k opportunity cost → acceptable risk given $6.25M+ downside protection. This is classic risk management: Cut losses early, don't wait for downgrade to happen (by then, price already down 12.5%).",
