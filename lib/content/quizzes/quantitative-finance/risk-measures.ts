      'Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) using three methods and compare results. Portfolio: $10M invested 60% equities, 40% bonds. Equities: μ=0.05% daily, σ=1.5% daily. Bonds: μ=0.02% daily, σ=0.4% daily. Correlation ρ=0.3. (1) Calculate 1-day 95% VaR using parametric (variance-covariance) method, (2) explain why historical simulation might give different results, (3) calculate 10-day VaR using square-root-of-time rule and discuss its limitations, (4) compare VaR across confidence levels (95%, 99%, 99.9%) and explain the tail risk not captured, (5) discuss VaR limitations using 2008 financial crisis examples.',
    sampleAnswer: `VaR Calculation and Analysis: (1) PARAMETRIC VaR (95%, 1-day): Portfolio composition: Equities: $6M (60%), Bonds: $4M (40%). Expected return: μ_p = 0.6 * 0.05% + 0.4 * 0.02% = 0.03% + 0.008% = 0.038% per day. Portfolio variance: σ_p^2 = w_e^2 * σ_e^2 + w_b^2 * σ_b^2 + 2*w_e*w_b*ρ*σ_e*σ_b. σ_p^2 = 0.6^2 * 1.5^2 + 0.4^2 * 0.4^2 + 2*0.6*0.4*0.3*1.5*0.4. = 0.36 * 2.25 + 0.16 * 0.16 + 0.144 * 0.6. = 0.81 + 0.0256 + 0.0864 = 0.922. σ_p = sqrt(0.922) = 0.96% per day. VaR at 95% confidence (z = -1.65 for loss): VaR_95 = -(μ_p + z * σ_p) = -(0.038% + (-1.65) * 0.96%) = -(0.038% - 1.584%) = -(-1.546%) = 1.546%. Dollar VaR = $10M * 1.546% = $154,600. Interpretation: 95% confident that 1-day loss will NOT exceed $154,600. Or: Expect losses > $154,600 on 5% of trading days (1 day per month). (2) HISTORICAL SIMULATION DIFFERENCES: Method: Use past 250 daily returns, sort from worst to best, take 5th percentile (13th worst return). Why different results: Parametric assumes: Normal distribution (symmetric, thin tails), Constant volatility and correlation, Linear relationships. Historical uses actual returns: Captures fat tails (extreme events more common than normal), Time-varying volatility (2008 crisis had σ > 3% daily), Non-linear relationships (bonds up when equities crash 2008). Example scenario: 2008 crisis included: 10 days with losses > 5% (far beyond 1.65σ = 2.5%), Equity-bond correlation went negative (flight to quality), VIX spiked to 80 (vs model σ=1.5% assumes VIX~20). Historical VaR (including 2008): 5th percentile = -3.2% (worst 13th day out of 250). Dollar VaR = $10M * 3.2% = $320,000 (vs parametric $154,600). Historical VaR 107% higher! This reflects fat tails. (3) 10-DAY VaR (Square-root-of-time): Rule: VaR(T days) = VaR(1-day) * sqrt(T). 10-day VaR_95 = $154,600 * sqrt(10) = $154,600 * 3.162 = $488,845. LIMITATIONS of sqrt-time rule: Assumes: Returns i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed), No autocorrelation (today's loss doesn't affect tomorrow), Constant volatility (volatility doesn't change over 10 days). Reality: Volatility clustering: Large moves followed by large moves (GARCH effects). After -3% day, next day volatility doubles → sqrt-time underestimates. Mean reversion: Extreme losses partially revert. Portfolio may recover, reducing multi-day loss. Liquidity constraints: Selling $400K of positions in 1 day vs 10 days → different market impact. Better approach: Multi-day simulation: Simulate 10-day paths with correlated daily returns (GARCH volatility), Or use overlapping 10-day historical windows (240 non-overlapping periods). Typically: Actual 10-day VaR = (1.5 to 2.5) * sqrt(10) * 1-day VaR. For volatile periods: 10-day VaR = $154,600 * 4 = $618,400 (vs naive $488,845). (4) VAR ACROSS CONFIDENCE LEVELS: 95% VaR = $154,600 (z = 1.65). 99% VaR: z = 2.33, VaR_99 = $10M * (0.038% + 2.33*0.96%) = $10M * 2.27% = $227,000. 99.9% VaR: z = 3.09, VaR_99.9 = $10M * (0.038% + 3.09*0.96%) = $10M * 3.0% = $300,000. Tail risk NOT captured: VaR says: "95% of time, loss ≤ $154,600." But silent on: 5% worst cases (could be $200K or $2M!). Expected loss when VaR exceeded (this is CVaR/ES). Example: 5% worst days: VaR_95 = $154,600, but average of 5% worst days = $250,000 (Expected Shortfall). VaR misses $95,400 of tail risk! Extreme scenarios: Black Monday 1987: -22.6% in 1 day. For $10M portfolio = $2.26M loss. VaR_99.9% says loss > $300K only 0.1% of time (1 day per 4 years). Reality: -$2M+ losses occur more often (fat tails). Solution: CVaR (Conditional VaR) = Expected loss given loss > VaR. (5) VAR LIMITATIONS (2008 Crisis Examples): LEHMAN BROTHERS (Sept 2008): Pre-crisis VaR: Lehman reported 95% daily VaR = $100M. Based on: Normal distribution, Correlation from 2006-2007 (calm period), Ignored tail risk (MBS correlations → 1 in crisis). Actual loss (Sept 15, 2008): Single-day loss > $10B (100x VaR!). Why VaR failed: Credit spreads widened 500bps in 1 day (10σ+ event), Liquidity dried up (couldn't sell MBS at any price), Correlations → 1 (all assets fell together). VaR assumed 30% correlation → actual 95%. LONG-TERM CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (1998): LTCM strategy: Long-short arbitrage (exploit small spreads). Diversified: 60,000 positions across bonds, equities, derivatives. VaR models: Showed low risk (diversification, offsetting positions). 99% VaR = $100M. Aug-Sept 1998 crisis: Russian default → flight to quality → spreads widened. All LTCM positions lost simultaneously (correlation → 1). 1-day loss: $500M (5x VaR_99). Total loss: $4.6B (46x VaR). Why VaR failed: Extreme event probabilities underestimated (Russian default considered negligible), Liquidity risk ignored (couldn't exit 60K positions), Model risk (historical correlations useless in crisis). KEY LIMITATIONS SUMMARY: Non-normal distributions: VaR assumes normal → underestimates fat tails (kurtosis > 3). Correlation breakdown: Historical correlations fail in crisis (→ 1), VaR overestimates diversification benefit. Liquidity risk: VaR assumes positions can be hedged/exited, Crisis: Bid-ask spreads blow out, markets freeze. Model risk: Garbage in, garbage out, Historical data doesn't include next crisis. Non-subadditivity: VaR(A+B) can exceed VaR(A) + VaR(B) (violates diversification). Regulatory arbitrage: Banks game VaR models to minimize capital requirements. Modern best practices: Supplement VaR with CVaR/ES (captures tail risk), Stress testing (2008-like scenario, even if low probability), Multiple methods (parametric, historical, Monte Carlo), Tail risk metrics (95th to 99th percentile expected loss), Independent validation (not just internal models).`,

    question:
      "Explain Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR/Expected Shortfall) and why it's superior to VaR for risk management. (1) Define CVaR mathematically and calculate it for a portfolio with historical returns, (2) demonstrate that CVaR is subadditive (satisfies diversification principle) while VaR is not, (3) show how CVaR is used in portfolio optimization (minimize CVaR vs minimize variance), (4) explain Basel Committee's shift from VaR to Expected Shortfall for bank capital requirements, (5) implement CVaR calculation using Python with realistic portfolio example.",
    sampleAnswer: `CVaR Analysis and Applications: (1) CVAR DEFINITION & CALCULATION: Mathematical definition: CVaR_α = E[L | L > VaR_α]. CVaR = Expected loss GIVEN that loss exceeds VaR threshold. Also called: ES (Expected Shortfall), AVaR (Average VaR), Tail VaR. HISTORICAL CALCULATION EXAMPLE: Portfolio: $10M, 250 daily returns (1 year). Sorted returns (worst to best): -4.2%, -3.8%, -3.5%, -3.2%, -3.0%, -2.9%, -2.8%, -2.6%, -2.5%, -2.4%, -2.3%, -2.1%, -2.0%, -1.8%, ... 95% VaR: 5th percentile = 13th worst return = -2.0%. Dollar VaR_95 = $10M * 2.0% = $200K. 95% CVaR: Average of 5% worst returns (12.5 worst days). Worst 12.5 returns: -4.2%, -3.8%, -3.5%, -3.2%, -3.0%, -2.9%, -2.8%, -2.6%, -2.5%, -2.4%, -2.3%, -2.1%, -2.0%. Average = (-4.2 -3.8 -3.5 -3.2 -3.0 -2.9 -2.8 -2.6 -2.5 -2.4 -2.3 -2.1 -2.0) / 13 = -37.3 / 13 = -2.87%. Dollar CVaR_95 = $10M * 2.87% = $287K. INTERPRETATION: VaR_95 = $200K: "95% of days, loss ≤ $200K." CVaR_95 = $287K: "On 5% worst days, AVERAGE loss is $287K." CVaR captures tail risk: $87K worse than VaR threshold. (2) SUBADDITIVITY (CVaR vs VaR): Subadditivity property: Risk(A + B) ≤ Risk(A) + Risk(B). Diversification should never INCREASE risk. CVaR is subadditive, VaR is NOT. EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATING VAR NON-SUBADDITIVITY: Asset A: Returns: 99 days of 0%, 1 day of -10%. VaR_95(A) = 0% (95th percentile is 0%). Asset B: Returns: 99 days of 0%, 1 day of -10% (uncorrelated with A). VaR_95(B) = 0%. Portfolio A+B (equal weight): If A loses on day 1, B doesn't: 50% * (-10%) + 50% * 0% = -5%. If B loses on day 20, A doesn't: 50% * 0% + 50% * (-10%) = -5%. 98 days: 0% return. VaR_95(A+B) = 5% (2 out of 100 days have -5% loss, 98 have 0%). Subadditivity violated: VaR(A+B) = 5% > VaR(A) + VaR(B) = 0% + 0% = 0%. Diversified portfolio has HIGHER VaR than sum! CVAR IS SUBADDITIVE (same example): CVaR_95(A): Average of 5% worst = -10% (only 1 worst day counts). CVaR_95(B): Average of 5% worst = -10%. CVaR_95(A+B): Average of 5% worst = (-5% * 2 days + 0% * 3 days) / 5 = -2%. Subadditivity satisfied: CVaR(A+B) = 2% < CVaR(A) + CVaR(B) = 10% + 10% = 20%. Diversification reduces CVaR (as expected). Why VaR fails: VaR only looks at single quantile (95th percentile). Ignores tail shape and averaging effects. CVaR averages over tail → captures diversification. (3) CVAR IN PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION: Traditional portfolio optimization (Markowitz): Minimize variance: min σ_p^2 = w^T Σ w. Subject to: Expected return ≥ target, Σ w_i = 1. Problem: Variance penalizes upside and downside equally. Doesn't focus on tail risk. CVaR optimization: Minimize CVaR_α: min CVaR_α(w). Subject to: Expected return ≥ target, Σ w_i = 1, w_i ≥ 0 (no shorts). FORMULATION (Rockafellar-Uryasev): CVaR_α = min_β { β + (1/(1-α)) * E[max(0, -r_p - β)] }. Where: r_p = portfolio return, β = VaR_α. Optimization becomes: min_{w,β} { β + (1/(1-α)) * Σ_scenarios max(0, -r_p - β) / N }. Linear programming problem (solvable efficiently). COMPARISON EXAMPLE (3 assets): Asset A: μ=10%, σ=20% (high return, high vol). Asset B: μ=8%, σ=15% (moderate). Asset C: μ=6%, σ=10% (low risk). Historical returns: A has fat left tail (skew = -1.5, kurtosis = 6). Minimum variance portfolio: w_A=20%, w_B=30%, w_C=50% (avoid high-vol A). Expected return: 7.6%, Variance: 108, σ=10.4%. CVaR_95: 18.5% (fat tail of A still impacts). Minimum CVaR portfolio: w_A=5%, w_B=35%, w_C=60% (strongly avoid fat-tail A). Expected return: 7.4%, Variance: 115, σ=10.7% (slightly higher vol). CVaR_95: 14.2% (23% lower tail risk!). Result: CVaR optimization sacrifices 0.2% return and 0.3% vol → 23% tail risk reduction. For risk-averse investors (pension funds, endowments): CVaR matters more than variance. (4) BASEL SHIFT FROM VAR TO ES: Basel III (pre-2016): Used VaR_99 (10-day) for market risk capital. Bank capital requirement = 3 * VaR_99. Problems: VaR incentivizes "cliff risk": Banks structure portfolios to minimize VaR (stay just below 99th percentile). But 1% tail can have massive losses. Example: VaR_99 = $100M, but single crisis day loses $500M. Non-subadditive: Penalizes diversification (acquisitions could increase capital requirements). Basel IV (2016 onwards): Replaced VaR with ES_97.5 (Expected Shortfall). Capital = function of ES, not VaR. WHY ES BETTER: Captures tail risk: ES averages over 2.5% worst cases (not just 99th percentile). Banks can't hide tail risk below single threshold. Subadditive: Rewards genuine diversification. Aligns with extreme stress scenarios. IMPLEMENTATION: Stressed ES: Calculate ES using stressed period (2008 crisis). Liquidity horizon: Different holding periods for asset classes (10 days stocks, 60 days illiquid credit). Non-modellable risks: Charge penalty for assets with insufficient data. Example capital requirement: Bank trading book: $10B. ES_97.5 (10-day) = $800M. Capital charge: $800M * 3 (multiplier) = $2.4B. Must hold $2.4B capital against potential tail losses.

    question:
      'Design a comprehensive stress testing framework for a multi-asset portfolio. (1) Explain the difference between VaR (statistical), stress testing (scenario), and sensitivity analysis, (2) construct historical stress scenarios: 2008 crisis, COVID crash, 1987 Black Monday, 2020 oil collapse, (3) build hypothetical stress scenarios: Fed raises rates 500bps, China recession, cyber attack on financial system, (4) calculate portfolio impact and identify vulnerability concentrations, (5) discuss reverse stress testing (what scenario causes failure?) and how it complements VaR.',
    sampleAnswer: `Comprehensive Stress Testing Framework: (1) RISK MEASUREMENT APPROACHES: VAR (Statistical, probability-based): Answers: "What is normal risk in 95% of cases?" Method: Historical returns, parametric (normal), or Monte Carlo. Timeframe: Daily/10-day for trading, monthly for investment. Limitation: Assumes future like past. Misses "black swans." Example: 1-day VaR_95 = $200K. "95% of days, loss < $200K." 2008 crisis: Lost $10M (50x VaR, 0.0001% probability event). STRESS TESTING (Scenario-based): Answers: "What if specific crisis occurs?" Method: Apply historical or hypothetical shocks to portfolio. Scenarios: 2008 crisis, COVID crash, Fed shock, geopolitical. Captures: Fat tails, correlations → 1, non-linear effects. Example: "What if 2008 repeats?" Equities: -40%, HY bonds: -35%, Correlations: 0.9. Result: Portfolio loses $3M (vs VaR $200K). SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS (Factor-based): Answers: "How does portfolio respond to specific factor moves?" Method: Shock one factor (rates, spreads, FX), hold others constant. Examples: +100bps interest rate shock, +50bps credit spread widening, EUR/USD depreciation 10%. Result: Duration loss $500K from +100bps rate shock. Limitation: Ignores correlation changes (factors move together in crisis). COMPARISON: VaR: Probability-based, normal environment, quantifiable. Stress: Scenario-based, extreme events, non-quantifiable probability. Sensitivity: Factor-based, linear approximation, building block. Best practice: Use all three (triangulate risk from multiple angles). (2) HISTORICAL STRESS SCENARIOS: 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS (Lehman bankruptcy, Sept-Oct 2008): Market moves: Equities (S&P 500): -20% in 1 month, -40% peak-to-trough. High yield bonds: -15%, investment grade corporate: -8%. Treasury yields: -50bps (flight to quality), Mortgage spreads: +300bps, TED spread: +250bps (credit freeze). VIX: 20 → 80 (4x increase). Correlations: All risky assets correlated at 0.95+ (diversification failed). Portfolio impact example: $10M portfolio: 60% stocks, 30% HY bonds, 10% IG bonds. Loss: 0.6 * $10M * (-40%) = -$2.4M (stocks), 0.3 * $10M * (-15%) = -$0.45M (HY), 0.1 * $10M * (-8%) = -$0.08M (IG). Total loss: $2.93M (29.3% drawdown). Lesson: Credit spreads blow out, leverage unwinds, liquidity vanishes. COVID CRASH (Feb-March 2020): Market moves: Equities: -34% in 4 weeks (fastest decline ever). Oil: $60 → $20 (demand collapse), gold: +10% (safe haven). Investment grade bonds: -10% (liquidity crunch), Treasuries: +15% (flight to quality). VIX: 15 → 85 (even higher than 2008 briefly). Recovery: V-shaped, +70% from bottom in 6 months (Fed stimulus). Portfolio impact: $10M: 50% stocks, 20% oil, 20% IG bonds, 10% gold. Loss: 0.5*(-34%) + 0.2*(-67%) + 0.2*(-10%) + 0.1*(+10%) = -17% - 13.4% - 2% + 1% = -31.4%. Total loss: $3.14M (31.4% drawdown). Lesson: Systemic shock (pandemic), all assets sold for liquidity, unprecedented speed. 1987 BLACK MONDAY (Oct 19, 1987): Market moves: S&P 500: -20.5% in single day (largest ever). Dow Jones: -22.6% (508 points from 2,246). Portfolio insurance selling accelerated decline (delta hedging death spiral). Bond yields: -50bps (flight to quality), Gold: +5%. Recovery: Gradual, 2 years to regain peak. Portfolio impact: $10M: 70% stocks, 20% bonds, 10% cash. Loss: 0.7*(-20.5%) + 0.2*(+3%) = -14.35% + 0.6% = -13.75%. Total loss: $1.375M (13.75% in 1 day!). Lesson: Liquidity crisis, mechanical selling (portfolio insurance), circuit breakers implemented after. 2020 OIL COLLAPSE (April 2020, negative WTI): Market moves: WTI crude: $20 → -$37/barrel (first negative price ever!). Storage capacity: Full (Cushing, OK tanks maxed out). Futures curve: Steep contango ($20 spot, $30 1-month, $40 2-month). Energy stocks: -60% (oil majors -30%, shale producers bankrupt). Ripple effects: High yield energy bonds: -40%, MLP pipelines: -50%. Portfolio impact: $10M: 20% energy stocks, 10% HY energy bonds, 70% diversified. Loss: 0.2*(-60%) + 0.1*(-40%) + 0.7*(0%) = -12% - 4% = -16%. Total loss: $1.6M (16% drawdown). Lesson: Physical constraints (storage), derivatives dislocations, sector concentration risk. (3) HYPOTHETICAL STRESS SCENARIOS: FED SHOCK: +500BPS RATE HIKE: Scenario: Fed combats inflation with emergency 5% rate hike over 6 months. Market moves: Treasury yields: +500bps (2% → 7%), Duration shock: Price decline ≈ -Duration * Δy = -7 * 5% = -35% for 7-year bond. Equities: -25% (higher discount rates), Growth stocks: -40% (long duration). Corporate bonds: -30% (duration + spread widening +150bps). Real estate: -50% (cap rates jump, financing costs surge). Mortgage rates: 3% → 8% (housing freeze). Portfolio impact: $10M: 40% stocks (20% growth, 20% value), 40% bonds (duration 7), 20% real estate. Loss: 0.2*(-40%) + 0.2*(-25%) + 0.4*(-35%) + 0.2*(-50%) = -8% - 5% - 14% - 10% = -37%. Total loss: $3.7M (37% drawdown, worst scenario). Vulnerabilities: Long duration bonds (7-year), growth stocks (high P/E), real estate (leveraged). Mitigation: Shift to short duration (<3 years), Add TIPS (inflation protection), Increase cash to 20%. CHINA RECESSION (Hard landing): Scenario: China GDP growth: 6% → -2% (credit bubble bursts, property collapse). Market moves: Emerging markets: -30% (trade linkages). Commodities: Copper -40%, Iron ore -50% (China demand crash). Developed equities: -15% (global supply chain disruption), CNY: Devalue 20% against USD (capital flight). Credit spreads: +200bps (EM corporates), +100bps (US/EU corporates). Portfolio impact: $10M: 30% EM stocks, 20% commodities, 40% US stocks, 10% cash. Loss: 0.3*(-30%) + 0.2*(-40%) + 0.4*(-15%) = -9% - 8% - 6% = -23%. Total loss: $2.3M (23% drawdown). Vulnerabilities: EM exposure (direct + commodity), China supply chain dependence. Mitigation: Limit EM to 15%, Hedge with CNY puts, Diversify commodities (add gold, energy). CYBER ATTACK ON FINANCIAL SYSTEM: Scenario: Coordinated attack disables major banks, exchanges, clearing houses for 1 week. Market moves: Markets closed: Trading halted 3-5 days (NYSE, NASDAQ, CME). Credit freeze: Unable to settle trades, margin calls, payments. Flight to physical: Cash withdrawals, gold +20%, Bitcoin volatile (±30%). Recovery: 2-week chaos, then stabilize with government intervention. Post-attack: Cybersecurity stocks +50%, Financial institutions -20% (liability). Portfolio impact: Immediate: Unable to trade or rebalance (operational risk). Mark-to-market: Assume 1-week closure → -10% across all risk assets (panic). $10M: 70% stocks, 20% bonds, 10% cash. Loss estimate: 0.7*(-10%) + 0.2*(-5%) = -7% - 1% = -8%. Total loss: $800K (8%, operational + liquidity). Secondary effects: Counterparty risk (brokers, custodians), Margin calls unfunded (forced liquidations), Confidence crisis (withdraw from markets). Vulnerabilities: Dependence on electronic systems, Lack of physical assets (gold, cash), Counterparty concentration (single broker). Mitigation: Diversify brokers/custodians, Hold physical gold (5%), Maintain 20% cash buffer. (4) PORTFOLIO IMPACT SUMMARY & VULNERABILITIES: Stress scenario results ($10M portfolio): VaR_95 (baseline): $200K (2%). 2008 crisis: -$2.93M (29.3%). COVID crash: -$3.14M (31.4%). Black Monday: -$1.375M (13.75%). Oil collapse: -$1.6M (16%). Fed +500bps: -$3.7M (37%, WORST). China recession: -$2.3M (23%). Cyber attack: -$800K (8%). VULNERABILITY CONCENTRATIONS: Interest rate risk: 40% bonds, duration 7 → $3.7M loss in Fed scenario. Equity concentration: 60-70% stocks → $2-3M losses in crisis scenarios. Sector risk: 20% energy → $1.6M loss in oil collapse. Geographic: 30% EM exposure → $2.3M loss in China scenario. Liquidity: Illiquid REITS, HY bonds → fire sale prices in crisis. HEAT MAP (Loss severity by asset): Asset | 2008 | COVID | Black Mon | Oil | Fed | China: Stocks (60%) | -40% | -34% | -20% | 0% | -25% | -15%: HY Bonds (20%) | -15% | -10% | 0% | -40% | -30% | 0%: IG Bonds (10%) | -8% | -10% | +3% | 0% | -35% | 0%: Real Estate (10%)| -25% | -15% | 0% | 0% | -50% | -10%. WORST PERFORMERS: Duration shock: Bonds -35% (Fed scenario). Growth stocks: -40% (2008, COVID, Fed). Energy: -60% (Oil scenario). EM: -30% (China scenario). Recommendation: REDUCE DURATION: 40% bonds, duration 7 → 30% bonds, duration 4. Cuts Fed scenario loss from -37% to -25%. DIVERSIFY SECTORS: Reduce energy to 10%, add healthcare, consumer staples. HEDGE TAILS: Buy VIX calls (cost 1% of portfolio), protect against >20% crashes. INCREASE CASH: 10% → 20% (dry powder for opportunities, liquidity buffer). (5) REVERSE STRESS TESTING: Definition: Work backwards from failure point. Question: "What scenario causes portfolio loss >50% (unacceptable)?" Method: Identify combination of shocks that trigger catastrophic loss. FAILURE THRESHOLD ANALYSIS: Assume failure = -50% portfolio loss ($5M of $10M). Current portfolio: 60% stocks, 40% bonds (duration 7). Reverse engineer: Loss equation: -50% = 0.6 * (stock_loss) + 0.4 * (bond_loss). Test scenarios: Scenario A: Stocks -60%, bonds -30% → Loss = 0.6*(-60%) + 0.4*(-30%) = -36% - 12% = -48% (close!). Need stocks -65%, bonds -30% → -39% -12% = -51% FAILURE. When does this occur? Stocks -65%: 2008 was -57% (peak-to-trough). Even worse than 2008, or 1929 (-89%) level. Bonds -30%: Fed hikes rates 10% (unprecedented), or sovereign debt crisis. Scenario B: Perfect storm: Stocks -50%, bonds -35%, real estate -70%. Loss = 0.5*(-50%) + 0.3*(-35%) + 0.2*(-70%) = -25% - 10.5% - 14% = -49.5% (FAILURE). Plausible? Stocks -50%: Severe recession (1973-74 was -48%). Bonds -35%: Hyperinflation or Fed loses credibility. Real estate -70%: 2008 housing was -30%, so 2x worse. REVERSE STRESS INSIGHTS: Vulnerabilities identified: Duration risk: If 10-year rates rise 7% → bonds -60% (alone causes failure with 40% allocation). Concentration: 70% risk assets → need simultaneous -70% to fail (very rare but possible). Leverage: If portfolio 1.5x leveraged → failure threshold drops to -33% (more fragile). COMPLEMENTING VAR: VaR says: "Risk is $200K (2% loss) in 95% of cases." Reverse stress says: "Risk is 100% LOSS if [specific unlikely scenario]." Example: VaR: "Safe 95% of time, expected loss $200K." Reverse: "But if stocks -65% + bonds -30% (1% probability), LOSE EVERYTHING." VaR focuses on: Frequent, small losses. Reverse stress focuses on: Rare, catastrophic losses (true risk of ruin). Combined framework: Daily management: VaR for position limits. Quarterly review: Stress testing for vulnerabilities. Annual: Reverse stress test to ensure no existential threats. Board reporting: "VaR is $200K, but reverse stress shows failure if stocks -65% + bonds -30%. Probability <1%, but mitigate by reducing duration."`,
