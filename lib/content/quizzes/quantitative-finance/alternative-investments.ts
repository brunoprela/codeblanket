      question:
        'A hedge fund charges 2% management fee and 20% performance fee with high-water mark. Starting NAV is $100M. Year 1: +20% return (\$120M). Year 2: -10% return (\$108M). Year 3: +15% return (\$124.2M). Calculate total fees paid over 3 years and explain why the high-water mark protects investors from paying performance fees on the same gains twice.',
      sampleAnswer: `**Fee calculations:** **Year 1**: NAV starts $100M, ends $120M (+$20M gain). Management fee: 2% × $100M = $2M. Performance fee: 20% × $20M = $4M. Total fees: $6M. Investor ending balance: $120M - $6M = $114M. **Year 2**: NAV starts $114M (after Year 1 fees), ends $102.6M (-10% = -$11.4M loss). Management fee: 2% × $114M = $2.28M. Performance fee: $0 (no gains, below high-water mark of $114M). Total fees: $2.28M. Investor ending balance: $102.6M - $2.28M = $100.32M. **Year 3**: NAV starts $100.32M, ends $115.37M (+15% = +$15.05M). Management fee: 2% × $100.32M = $2.006M. Performance fee: Only earned on gains above high-water mark (\$114M). New NAV before perf fee: $115.37M. Gain above high-water mark: $115.37M - $114M = $1.37M. Performance fee: 20% × $1.37M = $0.274M. Total fees: $2.006M + $0.274M = $2.28M. Investor ending balance: $115.37M - $2.28M = $113.09M. **Total fees over 3 years**: $6M + $2.28M + $2.28M = **$10.56M**. **High-water mark protection**: Without high-water mark, Year 3 performance fee would be 20% × $15.05M = $3.01M (calculated on full gain). With high-water mark, fee is only $0.274M—saving investors $2.74M. The high-water mark ensures managers only earn performance fees on NEW highs, not on recovering losses. In this example, the fund recovered from $100.32M to $114M (Year 3) but investors already paid performance fees on gains up to $114M in Year 1, so no double-dipping. **Investor perspective**: Without high-water mark, investors would pay performance fees in Year 1 (+20%), then pay again when recovering losses in Year 3, effectively paying fees twice on the same capital appreciation. High-water mark aligns manager incentives with investor outcomes—managers must create new value, not just recover old value, to earn performance fees.`,

      question:
        'A private equity fund targets 20% net IRR over 10 years with 2/20 fee structure and 8% hurdle rate. The fund invests $300M equity (with $700M debt, 70% LTV) to buy a company at 8× EBITDA. EBITDA is $125M at entry and grows to $200M at exit (year 7) due to operational improvements. The fund exits at 10× EBITDA. Calculate: (a) total equity value at exit, (b) gross IRR before fees, (c) net IRR after fees, and (d) how fees affect the 20% target return.',
      sampleAnswer: `**Setup**: Entry: $1B enterprise value (8× $125M EBITDA). Equity: $300M, Debt: $700M. Exit (Year 7): EBITDA = $200M, Exit multiple = 10×, Enterprise value = $2B. **(a) Total equity value at exit**: Enterprise value at exit: $2B. Less debt repayment: -$700M (assume debt unchanged, though in practice some would be paid down). **Equity value**: $2B - $700M = **$1.3B**. Equity gain: $1.3B - $300M initial equity = **$1B profit** (3.33× money multiple). **(b) Gross IRR before fees**: $300M grows to $1.3B over 7 years. IRR formula: $300M × (1 + r)^7 = $1.3B. (1 + r)^7 = 4.33. r = 4.33^(1/7) - 1 = 1.237 - 1 = **23.7% gross IRR**. **(c) Net IRR after fees**: **Management fees**: 2% on committed capital (\$300M) × 7 years = $42M (assuming simplification; in practice, fees are on remaining capital). **Performance fees (carried interest)**: LPs earn 8% hurdle first. LP hurdle return: $300M × (1.08)^7 = $514M. Profits above hurdle: $1.3B - $514M = $786M. GP carried interest: 20% × $786M = $157.2M. LP share of carry: 80% × $786M = $628.8M. **LP total**: $514M (hurdle) + $628.8M (carry share) = $1,142.8M. **GP total**: $42M (mgmt fees) + $157.2M (carry) = $199.2M. Check: $1,142.8M + $199.2M = $1,342M ≈ $1.3B (slight rounding). **LP net IRR**: $300M grows to $1,142.8M over 7 years. Net IRR: (1,142.8/300)^(1/7) - 1 = 3.809^(1/7) - 1 = **20.4% net IRR** (achieves target!). **(d) Fee impact**: Gross IRR = 23.7%, Net IRR = 20.4% → **Fee drag = 3.3%** annually. Breakdown: Management fees (2% on $300M) = $42M / 7 years = $6M/year ≈ 2% annually. Carried interest (20% of profits above hurdle) = $157M / 7 years = $22.4M/year ≈ 1.3% annually. Total drag ≈ 3.3% annually. **Key insight**: Despite "2 and 20" sounding expensive, the net IRR (20.4%) exceeds the target (20%) because gross IRR (23.7%) is strong enough to absorb fees. The 8% hurdle protects LPs by ensuring they earn preferred return before GP earns carry. In this case, operational improvements (EBITDA growth from $125M → $200M) and multiple expansion (8× → 10×) drove strong returns, justifying the fee structure.`,

      question:
        'An institutional investor (pension fund) currently allocates 60% equities, 40% bonds (expected return 8%, vol 10%, Sharpe 0.6). They consider adding 20% alternatives (reducing equities to 50%, bonds to 30%). Alternatives consist of: 10% private equity (15% return, 20% vol), 5% hedge funds (10% return, 8% vol), 5% real estate (9% return, 12% vol). Correlations: PE-equities 0.6, hedge-equities 0.4, RE-equities 0.5, PE-bonds 0.2, hedge-bonds 0.2, RE-bonds 0.3. Calculate the new portfolio expected return, volatility, and Sharpe. Would you recommend the allocation change? Discuss liquidity, fees, and institutional constraints.',
      sampleAnswer: `**Portfolio calculations:** Assume equities: 10% return, 15% vol; bonds: 4% return, 5% vol; 60/40 correlation 0.2. **(a) Original 60/40 portfolio**: Return: 0.6×10% + 0.4×4% = 7.6%. Vol: √[(0.6²×15²) + (0.4²×5²) + (2×0.6×0.4×0.2×15×5)] = √[81 + 4 + 7.2] = √92.2 = 9.6%. Sharpe: 7.6% / 9.6% = **0.79**. **(b) New portfolio with alternatives (50% eq, 30% bonds, 10% PE, 5% HF, 5% RE)**: Return: 0.5×10% + 0.3×4% + 0.1×15% + 0.05×10% + 0.05×9% = 5% + 1.2% + 1.5% + 0.5% + 0.45% = **8.65%** (↑1.05%). Volatility calculation (covariance matrix, simplified): Major terms: Equity var: (0.5×15)² = 56.25. Bond var: (0.3×5)² = 2.25. PE var: (0.1×20)² = 4. HF var: (0.05×8)² = 0.16. RE var: (0.05×12)² = 0.36. Covariances (2×w1×w2×ρ×σ1×σ2): Eq-Bond: 2×0.5×0.3×0.2×15×5 = 4.5. Eq-PE: 2×0.5×0.1×0.6×15×20 = 18. Eq-HF: 2×0.5×0.05×0.4×15×8 = 2.4. Eq-RE: 2×0.5×0.05×0.5×15×12 = 2.25. (Other terms smaller, omitted for brevity). Sum ≈ 56.25 + 2.25 + 4 + 0.16 + 0.36 + 4.5 + 18 + 2.4 + 2.25 + (other) ≈ 92. Vol ≈ √92 = **9.6%** (roughly unchanged). Sharpe: 8.65% / 9.6% = **0.90** (↑14% from 0.79). **(c) Recommendation**: **Pros of adding alternatives**: (1) Higher expected return (+1.05%) with similar volatility → Sharpe improvement +14%. (2) Diversification: Alternatives have 0.2-0.6 correlation with equities (lower than equity-equity correlation 1.0). (3) Access to illiquidity premium (PE earns 15% vs equities 10% = 5% premium for 10-year lockup). (4) Downside protection: Hedge funds target absolute return (low market beta), reducing drawdowns. **Cons and institutional constraints**: (1) **Illiquidity**: PE has 10-year lockup, limiting pension\'s ability to meet liabilities if liquidity crunch occurs. For pension with 70% funding ratio, this could be problematic. Recommendation: Limit illiquid alts to 10-15% (current 10% PE + 5% RE = 15% is acceptable). (2) **Fees**: PE/HF charge 2-and-20, reducing net returns by 2-3% annually. If PE gross return is 18% (net 15%), and equities are 10%, net premium is only 5% vs 8% gross—still attractive but less dramatic. (3) **Operational complexity**: Alternatives require due diligence, manager selection, monitoring (20-30 manager relationships). Need dedicated staff (2-3 FTEs for $500M allocation). (4) **Valuation risk**: PE/RE mark-to-model (not market) → inflated Sharpe ratios (smoothed returns, understated volatility). True vol likely 25%+ for PE (not 20%), reducing Sharpe. (5) **Denominator effect**: If equities crash -40% (like 2008), pension\'s funding ratio drops and alternatives become >30% of portfolio (due to lower equity denominator), forcing rebalancing. **Final recommendation**: **YES, proceed with allocation but with caveats**: (1) Limit illiquid assets (PE+RE) to 15% to maintain liquidity buffer. (2) Focus on top-quartile PE managers (20%+ net IRR; bottom-quartile earns <8%, underperforming equities). (3) Use liquid alternatives (UCITS hedge funds, listed private equity) for 5-10% to maintain some liquidity. (4) Ensure pension has 10+ year horizon (illiquid alts unsuitable for underfunded pensions needing liquidity). **Bottom line**: For a well-funded pension (\$1B+ AUM, 80%+ funding ratio, long horizon), the 20% alternatives allocation improves risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe +14%) and reduces equity concentration risk. However, requires operational sophistication and disciplined manager selection.`,
