      question:
        'A momentum strategy uses 12-month lookback (skipping the most recent month) with monthly rebalancing. During backtest (2000-2020), it achieves Sharpe 0.8 in bull markets (2003-2007, 2009-2020) but Sharpe -0.3 in bear markets (2000-2002, 2008). In 2009, the strategy lost -40% in a single month during the post-Lehman rally (losers rallied 150% while winners fell 20%). Design a risk management framework to mitigate momentum crashes while preserving long-run performance. Address: volatility scaling, market state filters, stop-losses, and crisis hedges.',
      sampleAnswer: `**Momentum crash mitigation framework:** **(1) Volatility scaling (most critical)**: Scale position size inversely to realized volatility. Position = w_base × (σ_target / σ_realized). Example: Target 10% vol. If realized vol spikes from 15% to 40% (crisis), cut position from 1× to 0.375× (10%/40% vs 10%/15%). This would have reduced 2009 momentum crash loss from -73% to -27% (by cutting leverage during high-vol period). Mechanism: Momentum crashes occur during high-vol regimes (crisis reversals), so reducing exposure when vol spikes directly addresses the risk. **(2) Market state filter (trend breaks)**: Exit momentum positions when market breaks 200-day moving average. Example: S&P 500 broke 200-day MA in Oct 2008 → exit all momentum positions → avoid March 2009 crash (when losers rallied sharply). Rationale: Momentum works in trending markets but fails during reversals. 200-day MA break signals potential regime change from trend to reversal. Backtest shows this filter reduces max drawdown from -50% to -25% while reducing returns only 10-15%. **(3) Defensive stops (position-level and portfolio-level)**: (a) Position stop: Exit individual positions after -15% loss (vs -40% without stop). (b) Portfolio stop: If portfolio drawdown exceeds -20%, cut all positions to 50%. If exceeds -30%, exit entirely (preserve capital). (c) Time stop: If position held >6 months without profit, exit (momentum died). Example: 2009 crash would trigger portfolio stop at -20%, cutting exposure from 100% to 50%, limiting further losses. **(4) Crisis hedges (tail risk protection)**: Allocate 1-2% of capital to OTM puts (3-6 month, 10-20% out-of-the-money). During crashes, these puts appreciate 5-10×, offsetting 5-20% of momentum losses. Cost: -1.5% annual drag (put premiums), but saves -30% in crashes (net benefit +28.5% during crashes). Alternatively: Dynamic hedge (buy puts when VIX >25, sell when VIX <15). **(5) Diversification across timeframes**: Combine 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month momentum signals (equal weight). Rationale: Different horizons crash at different times-6-month crashed in March 2009, but 24-month crashed in late 2009. Combining reduces single-point-of-failure risk. Portfolio Sharpe improves from 0.8 to 1.0 due to diversification. **Comprehensive implementation**: Apply ALL five components. Backtest results (2000-2020): Without risk management: Sharpe 0.8, max DD -73%, annual return 12%. With framework: Sharpe 1.1 (improved!), max DD -25% (67% reduction), annual return 10% (slight reduction). **Trade-off**: Accept 2% lower return to reduce max drawdown 67%-dramatically improves risk-adjusted performance.`,

      question:
        'You backtest a short-term mean reversion strategy (1-week horizon) on U.S. large-cap stocks (2010-2023). Strategy: rank stocks by weekly return, long bottom decile, short top decile, hold 5 days. Backtest shows gross Sharpe 1.2, annual return 18%, turnover 2500%. When you paper-trade the strategy, you achieve Sharpe 0.3, annual return 5%. Explain the likely causes of this performance degradation (backtest vs live) and how you would diagnose and fix each issue. Consider: transaction costs, market impact, timing luck, data quality, and capacity constraints.',
      sampleAnswer: `**Performance degradation diagnosis (Sharpe 1.2 → 0.3, return 18% → 5%):** This 73% return reduction and 75% Sharpe reduction suggests multiple compounding issues. **(1) Transaction costs underestimated**: Backtest used 5 bps cost assumption, but live trading incurs: (a) Bid-ask spread: 10 bps (large-cap), (b) Market impact: 5-10 bps (walking the book on 10% decile), (c) Slippage: 5 bps (execution vs signal time), (d) Total: 20-25 bps per side = 40-50 bps round-trip (vs 5 bps assumed). Impact: 2500% turnover × 45 bps true cost = 11.25% annual (vs 2500% × 5 bps = 1.25% assumed). Cost underestimate: 10% annually! This alone explains most of the degradation (18% gross → 8% net if 10% cost). **Diagnosis**: Compare backtest fill prices (mid-quote) vs live fill prices (actual execution). Measure spread + impact per trade. **Fix**: (a) Use realistic cost model (40-50 bps), (b) Reduce turnover (hold 10 days instead of 5), (c) Optimize execution (use limit orders, VWAP algo). **(2) Market impact from size**: Backtest assumed infinite liquidity (traded $10M positions without impact). Live trading: $10M = 0.5% of daily volume → market impact 10-20 bps (Almgren-Chriss). Additionally, HFTs detect pattern (predictable rebalancing) and front-run → extra 5-10 bps cost. Impact: 15-25 bps per trade = 7.5% annually at 2500% turnover. **Diagnosis**: Track execution shortfall (fill price vs arrival price). Measure impact as function of order size. **Fix**: (a) Reduce AUM ($50M → $25M), (b) Randomize rebalance times (avoid predictable Friday close), (c) Split orders (iceberg, TWAP). **(3) Timing luck (backtest overfits specific time window)**: 2010-2023 included unusual periods (2020 pandemic-extreme reversals). Strategy might have captured one-time events that won't repeat. In-sample Sharpe 1.2 is suspiciously high for mean reversion (typical 0.5-0.8). **Diagnosis**: Walk-forward analysis (rolling optimization). Check if Sharpe stable across sub-periods. **Fix**: Lower expectations-if walk-forward shows Sharpe 0.6-0.8, that's realistic (current 0.3 still underperforms). **(4) Data quality issues**: Backtests often use adjusted prices (survivorship-bias-free, point-in-time) but live trading uses real-time feeds (stale quotes, bad ticks, corporate actions). Also, backtest may have lookahead bias (used restated financials available only later). Impact: 2-3% annual return difference. **Diagnosis**: Audit backtest data vs live data. Check for lookahead (signal uses data not available at decision time). **Fix**: Use as-reported data, point-in-time databases (CRSP). **(5) Capacity constraints**: As AUM grows, strategy degrades. Mean reversion has low capacity ($10-50M). If you scaled from $10M (backtest) to $50M (live), impact and costs would double, reducing returns proportionally. **Diagnosis**: Test strategy at multiple AUM levels (simulate impact scaling). **Fix**: Close strategy to new capital at $25M (maintain profitability). **Combined diagnosis**: Cost underestimate (10%), market impact (7.5%), timing luck (2%), data issues (2%) = 21.5% return drag. This fully explains degradation (18% - 21.5% ≈ -3%, but actual 5% suggests partial mitigation). **Actionable fixes**: (1) Reduce turnover 50% → save 5.6% costs, (2) Reduce AUM 50% → save 3.5% impact, (3) Use VWAP execution → save 2% slippage. Net improvement: +11% return → expect 16% gross, 5% net (Sharpe 0.5-0.6). **Conclusion**: Backtest-to-live degradation is normal (expect 30-50% Sharpe reduction) but this case (75% reduction) indicates serious cost underestimation and capacity issues.`,

      question:
        'Compare three portfolio allocation strategies: (1) 100% 12-month momentum, (2) 100% 1-week mean reversion, (3) 50% momentum + 50% mean reversion. For each, calculate expected Sharpe ratio given: momentum Sharpe = 0.8, mean reversion Sharpe = 0.6, correlation = -0.3. Explain why combining negatively correlated strategies improves risk-adjusted returns and design an optimal multi-strategy portfolio that includes momentum, mean reversion, and trend following.',
      sampleAnswer: `**Portfolio Sharpe calculations:** **(1) 100% momentum**: Sharpe = 0.8 (given). **(2) 100% mean reversion**: Sharpe = 0.6 (given). **(3) 50/50 momentum + mean reversion**: Combined portfolio return: R_p = 0.5×R_mom + 0.5×R_mr. Combined portfolio vol: σ_p = √(w_mom² × σ_mom² + w_mr² × σ_mr² + 2×w_mom×w_mr×ρ×σ_mom×σ_mr). Assume equal vol: σ_mom = σ_mr = σ (for simplicity). σ_p = σ × √(0.5² + 0.5² + 2×0.5×0.5×(-0.3)) = σ × √(0.25 + 0.25 - 0.15) = σ × √0.35 = 0.59σ. Portfolio return: R_p = 0.5×(0.8×σ) + 0.5×(0.6×σ) = 0.7σ. **Portfolio Sharpe**: 0.7σ / 0.59σ = **1.19** (48% higher than momentum alone!). **Key insight**: Negative correlation (-0.3) provides diversification benefit-portfolio vol (0.59σ) is 41% lower than average component vol (1.0σ), while return only drops 13% (0.7 vs 0.8). This demonstrates why combining strategies with low/negative correlation is the "free lunch" of quantitative portfolio management. **Optimal multi-strategy portfolio (momentum + mean reversion + trend following):** Assume trend following: Sharpe 0.5, correlation with momentum 0.4, correlation with mean reversion -0.2. **Optimization objective**: Maximize Sharpe = (w_mom×R_mom + w_mr×R_mr + w_tf×R_tf) / √(w′Σw), where Σ is covariance matrix. Using mean-variance optimization (quadratic programming): **Optimal weights**: Momentum 45%, Mean reversion 35%, Trend following 20%. **Rationale**: (1) Momentum gets highest weight (highest Sharpe 0.8), (2) Mean reversion gets moderate weight (Sharpe 0.6, negative correlation with mom adds value), (3) Trend following gets low weight (lowest Sharpe 0.5, positive correlation with mom reduces diversification). **Portfolio Sharpe**: 1.35 (69% improvement over momentum alone). **Performance across regimes**: Bull market (2009-2020): Momentum +20%, mean reversion +8%, trend following +15% → portfolio +15% (momentum dominates). Bear market (2008): Momentum -30%, mean reversion +10% (reversals), trend following +12% (short signals) → portfolio -3% (hedged by mr/tf). Choppy market (2015-2016): Momentum -5% (whipsaws), mean reversion +12%, trend following -8% → portfolio +2% (mean reversion shines). **Risk management at portfolio level**: (1) Correlation monitoring: If correlations converge (all strategies >0.5 correlation), reduce leverage (diversification benefits vanished). (2) Regime-based tilting: Bull market → overweight momentum (60%), bear market → overweight mean reversion (50%), choppy → overweight mean reversion (60%). (3) Volatility targeting: Scale entire portfolio to 10% target vol (constant risk). **Conclusion**: Multi-strategy portfolios achieve higher Sharpe (1.35 vs 0.8) by combining low-correlated strategies. The optimal allocation tilts toward higher-Sharpe strategies but includes lower-Sharpe strategies if they provide diversification (negative correlation). This is the foundation of quantitative hedge fund portfolios (AQR, Renaissance combine 10-50 strategies to achieve Sharpe >2.0).`,
