    question:
      'The Black-Scholes model assumes constant volatility, yet real markets exhibit volatility smiles and skews. Explain: (1) what causes volatility smile and skew in equity vs currency markets, (2) how this affects option pricing for OTM puts vs calls, (3) practical adjustments traders make when pricing with Black-Scholes, (4) which options are most mispriced by constant volatility assumption, (5) how implied volatility surface is used in practice. Include specific examples.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Volatility smile/skew analysis: (1) CAUSES: Equity skew (higher IV for OTM puts): Post-1987 crash, demand for downside protection, leverage effect (negative returns increase volatility), crash fear embedded in put prices. Example: SPY $400, 30-day ATM IV=20%, $360 put IV=28% (40% higher). Currency smile (symmetric): Fat tails in FX (more extreme moves than normal distribution), less directional bias, emerging market crises create two-sided tail risk. (2) PRICING IMPACT: Equity: $360 put (20% OTM) with flat IV=20% → $3.50, with skew IV=28% → $5.80 (+66%). $440 call (10% OTM) with flat IV=20% → $4.20, with skew IV=18% → $3.60 (-14%). Skew systematically: underprices OTM puts (hedge too cheap with flat vol), overprices OTM calls (speculation too expensive). Real cost of portfolio protection 50-100% higher than flat Black-Scholes suggests. (3) PRACTICAL ADJUSTMENTS: (a) Implied volatility surface: Build 2D grid of IV(Strike, Expiration). Use market IVs from liquid options, interpolate for illiquid strikes. Price all options with strike-specific IV, not single vol. (b) Sticky strike vs sticky delta: Sticky strike: IV tied to absolute strike (vol smile moves with spot). Sticky delta: IV tied to moneyness (vol smile moves with spot). Most markets are between (sticky strike for short-term, sticky delta for long-term). (c) SVI parameterization: Smooth IV curve with 5 parameters to interpolate/extrapolate. (4) MOST MISPRICED OPTIONS: Deep OTM puts (10-20% OTM): Black-Scholes assumes IV same as ATM, reality IV is 30-50% higher. Example: AAPL $150, buying $120 put protection (20% OTM) for crash. Flat BS: IV=25% → put=$0.80. Real skew: IV=38% → put=$1.80 (125% higher!). Deep OTM calls also mispriced but less extreme (10-20% difference). Tail risk hedges (puts at 2-3 std dev) most affected. Near ATM options (<5% from spot) least affected (±5% error). (5) IMPLIED VOLATILITY SURFACE USAGE: Before trading: Extract IV from market prices of liquid options (top 10-20 strikes per expiration). Build 2D surface IV(K, T) using interpolation (cubic spline, SVI model). For illiquid option: Look up IV from surface, calculate BS price with that IV. Risk management: Calculate Greeks using local IV (vega hedge requires matching IVs). Monitor surface changes (skew steepening = fear increasing). Arbitrage detection: If new option price deviates >2σ from surface → arbitrage signal. CONCRETE EXAMPLE: SPY at $450, trading iron condor. Using flat IV=20%: Sell $430 put (IV should be 24%), sell $470 call (IV should be 18%). Underpricing put side by 20%, overpricing call side by 10%. Result: Less profitable than expected. Better: Use market IVs from surface → $430 put sell for $3.50 (vs $2.80 flat), $470 call sell for $2.20 (vs $2.50 flat). Collect more premium on put side (where IV is truly higher).',

    question:
      'Derive the put-call parity relationship and use it to identify arbitrage opportunities. Given: Stock=$100, Strike=$100, T=1 year, r=5%, Call=$8, Put=$6. (1) State put-call parity formula and derive it from no-arbitrage, (2) check if arbitrage exists in this example, (3) construct the arbitrage strategy with specific positions, (4) calculate profit, (5) explain why arbitrage opportunities are rare but do occur (market frictions, American vs European, dividends).',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Put-Call Parity and Arbitrage: (1) FORMULA: C - P = S - K*e^(-rT) (for European options). DERIVATION from no-arbitrage: Portfolio A: Long call + Short put (synthetic long stock). Portfolio B: Long stock + Short bond (sell bond worth K at maturity). Both portfolios have identical payoff at expiration: If S_T > K: Portfolio A = (S_T - K) - 0 = S_T - K, Portfolio B = S_T - K. If S_T < K: Portfolio A = 0 - (K - S_T) = S_T - K, Portfolio B = S_T - K. Identical payoffs → must have same price today (no-arbitrage). C + P = S + K*e^(-rT). Rearranging: C - P = S - K*e^(-rT). (2) CHECK FOR ARBITRAGE: Given: S=$100, K=$100, T=1, r=5%, C=$8, P=$6. LHS: C - P = $8 - $6 = $2. RHS: S - K*e^(-rT) = $100 - $100*e^(-0.05*1) = $100 - $95.12 = $4.88. LHS ($2) ≠ RHS ($4.88). MISPRICING: $2.88 per share! Arbitrage exists. (3) ARBITRAGE STRATEGY: LHS < RHS means: Call - Put < Stock - Bond. Buy undervalued side (call - put), Sell overvalued side (stock - bond). POSITIONS: Buy 1 call: -$8 (cash out), Sell 1 put: +$6 (cash in), Short 100 shares stock: +$100 (cash in), Buy bond (lend $95.12): -$95.12 (cash out). Net cash inflow TODAY: -$8 + $6 + $100 - $95.12 = +$2.88 (risk-free profit!). (4) PAYOFF AT EXPIRATION: If S_T = $110 (above strike): Exercise call, buy stock at $100, close short at $110: $0, Put expires worthless: $0, Collect bond: +$100, Net: $0 (all offsets). If S_T = $90 (below strike): Call expires: $0, Assigned on put, buy stock at $100, close short at $90: $0, Collect bond: +$100, Net: $0. All scenarios: $0 at expiration, but collected $2.88 today = PURE ARBITRAGE. (5) WHY RARE IN PRACTICE: Market frictions: Bid-ask spread: Call bid=$7.90, ask=$8.10, Put bid=$5.90, ask=$6.10. True arbitrage after spreads: Buy call at $8.10, sell put at $5.90, net = $2.20 (vs theoretical $2). After spreads, profit drops to $2.88 - $0.40 = $2.48 (still profitable but smaller). Borrow cost: Short stock borrow fee 0.5-2% annually. Interest on bond = 5%, but pay borrow fee → net 3-4.5%. Transaction costs: $0.65 per option contract, $0.01/share stock = $2 total. From $2.88 to $0.88 after costs (still profitable). Speed: High-frequency traders detect and exploit within milliseconds. By time retail trader sees it, gone. American vs European: Put-call parity valid only for European options. American options can be exercised early → C_american - P_american > S - K*e^(-rT). Early exercise premium breaks parity. Most US stock options are American → frequent deviations. Dividends: Formula assumes no dividends. With dividend yield q: C - P = S*e^(-qT) - K*e^(-rT). Ignoring dividends causes apparent "arbitrage" that isn\'t real. Example: Stock pays 2% dividend. Adjusted: C - P = $100*e^(-0.02) - $95.12 = $98.02 - $95.12 = $2.90 (vs $2 actual = closer, may be within spread). Pin risk: At expiration, if stock exactly at strike, unclear if assigned → operational risk. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE: 2010 Flash Crash: During 5-minute crash, put-call parity violated by >$5 per share on SPY options. Market makers pulled quotes, arbitrageurs couldn\'t execute all legs simultaneously. Violations collapsed within 30 minutes as market recovered.',

    question:
      'Design a volatility trading strategy using implied vs realized volatility. Explain: (1) how to forecast whether implied volatility is over/underpriced relative to realized volatility, (2) constructing a delta-neutral position to isolate volatility exposure, (3) calculating P&L attribution (from gamma, vega, theta), (4) risk management and rehedging frequency, (5) when to close the position. Assume: SPY at $450, 30-day ATM straddle costs $15 (IV=25%), you forecast realized vol will be 30%.',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Volatility trading strategy (long gamma): (1) IMPLIED VS REALIZED VOL FORECAST: Implied volatility (IV): Market's expectation of future vol, extracted from option prices. SPY 30-day IV = 25% (from ATM straddle price). Historical realized vol: Calculate from past returns. 30-day realized = 28%, 60-day = 26%, 90-day = 22%. VIX (SPY implied vol index) = 20 (calm market). FORECAST: Earnings season approaching for mega-cap tech (30% of SPY). Geopolitical uncertainty (Middle East tensions). Historical: Vol spikes from 20→35+ during crisis. PREDICTION: Realized vol will be 30-35% over next 30 days. IV at 25% is UNDERPRICED. ACTION: Buy volatility (long straddle). (2) DELTA-NEUTRAL CONSTRUCTION: Position: Buy ATM straddle at $450 strike for $15 ($7.50 call + $7.50 put). Cost: $15 × 100 = $1,500 per straddle. Greeks at initiation: Delta ≈ 0 (call delta +0.50, put delta -0.50 offset). Gamma = +0.018 (profit from stock movement). Vega = +$25 per 1% IV change. Theta = -$8 per day (time decay cost). Net exposure: Long volatility (profit if stock moves or IV rises), Short time (lose if stock stays still). (3) P&L ATTRIBUTION OVER 30 DAYS: Scenario A: Stock moves significantly (realized vol 30%), IV stays 25%. Day 5: SPY moves $450→$465 (+$15). Delta was 0, but stock moved → gamma profit. Gamma P&L = 0.5 × Gamma × (ΔS)² = 0.5 × 0.018 × 15² = $2.03 per straddle ($203 for 100 contracts). Rehedge: Call now delta +0.75, put delta -0.25, net delta +0.50. Sell 50 shares SPY to get back to delta-neutral. Day 5-30: Stock oscillates $465→$435→$458 (high realized vol). Each swing generates gamma profit. Total gamma P&L: +$3,500 (20 rehedges, avg $175 each). Theta decay over 30 days: -$8 × 30 = -$240 per straddle. Vega: IV unchanged = $0. NET P&L: +$3,500 - $2,400 = +$1,100 (from realized vol 30% > implied vol 25%). Scenario B: Stock doesn't move but IV spikes to 35%. Stock at $450 (no movement), zero gamma P&L. Vega P&L: Straddle vega=$25 per 1% IV. IV increase: 35% - 25% = +10%. Vega profit: $25 × 10 = +$250 per straddle ($25,000 for 100 contracts). Theta decay: -$240. NET P&L: +$250 - $240 = +$10 per straddle ($1,000 total). Exit before theta kills profit. (4) RISK MANAGEMENT & REHEDGING: Rehedging frequency: Delta-neutral: Rehedge when delta > ±0.10 (stock moved enough that position directional). Costs $0.01/share × 100 shares × # rehedges = $1 per rehedge. Trade-off: More frequent hedging = less delta risk but higher transaction costs. Optimal: Rehedge when delta reaches 0.10-0.15 (≈2-3 times per week). Gamma scalping: Each rehedge locks in gamma profit (buy low, sell high automatically). Profit = 0.5 × Gamma × (ΔS)². Risk limits: Max loss if stock doesn't move: -$240 theta over 30 days (16% of capital). Stop loss: If IV crashes to 15% (unexpected calm), exit immediately. If realized vol stays at 20% (below forecast), theta will dominate → exit by day 20. (5) EXIT CRITERIA: Profit target: If IV spikes to 30%+ (before stock movement), vega profit achieved → exit. If realized vol clearly 30%+, collect gamma profits → exit at day 20 (avoid final week theta acceleration). Stop loss: If 15 days pass and realized vol <20% (forecast wrong), exit and take -$120 loss (half theta). If IV collapses <20% (unexpected), exit immediately (vega loss plus theta). Avoid last week: Theta accelerates in final 7 days (from $8/day to $20/day). Exit by day 23 even if slightly losing (gamma unlikely to overcome theta). ACTUAL OUTCOME (HYPOTHETICAL): Days 1-10: SPY range-bound $450-$455, minimal gamma, -$80 theta. Day 11: Fed meeting, surprise hawkish, SPY drops $450→$430 (-$20). Gamma profit: 0.5 × 0.018 × 20² = $3.60 per straddle ($360). Rehedge 4 times as stock rebounds $430→$445 (+$450 gamma). Days 11-20: Continued volatility, total gamma: +$1,100. Day 20: IV spikes to 28% (geopolitical event), vega: +$25 × 3 = +$75. Exit day 20: Gamma +$1,100, Vega +$75, Theta -$160 = Net +$1,015 (67% ROI in 20 days). SUCCESS: Realized vol (30%) > Implied vol (25%) → profitable.",
