    question:
      'You manage a $10M equity portfolio and hold 50 long call contracts (SPY $450 strike, 60 days to expiration, delta=0.65, gamma=0.012, theta=-$15/day, vega=$35). The portfolio has increased correlation with SPY from 0.70 to 0.85 due to sector concentration. Design a comprehensive delta-hedging strategy: (1) Calculate current delta exposure and required hedge, (2) Determine optimal rehedging frequency considering transaction costs ($0.01/share + $5 per trade), (3) Account for gamma changes as market moves, (4) Analyze P&L attribution from delta, gamma, and theta over a 10-day period with 3% SPY move, (5) Explain when to stop delta-hedging and take directional exposure.',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Delta-hedging comprehensive analysis: (1) CURRENT DELTA EXPOSURE: Options position: 50 contracts × 100 shares × 0.65 delta = 3,250 delta exposure. Equivalent to being long 3,250 shares of SPY at $450 = $1,462,500 notional exposure. Portfolio beta-adjusted exposure: Portfolio value $10M, correlation 0.85, equivalent beta = 0.85. SPY exposure from portfolio: $10M × 0.85 / $450 = 18,889 shares equivalent. TOTAL DELTA: 3,250 (options) + 18,889 (portfolio) = 22,139 shares of SPY exposure. DELTA-NEUTRAL HEDGE: Short 22,139 shares SPY at $450 = $9,962,550. Cost: $9,962,550 × 0.0001 (borrow rate, if applicable) = ~$996/day + $5 trade fee. (2) OPTIMAL REHEDGING FREQUENCY: Transaction costs per rehedge: $0.01/share × shares traded + $5 fixed. Example rehedge of 1,000 shares: $0.01 × 1,000 + $5 = $15. Gamma risk: Γ = 0.012 means delta changes by 0.012 per $1 SPY move. For $10 move: Delta change = 0.012 × 10 = 0.12 per contract. For 50 contracts: Total delta change = 0.12 × 50 × 100 = 600 shares. Decision criteria: Rehedge when |delta deviation| > 500 shares (about 2.3% of position). SPY needs to move ~$8.33 to trigger rehedge (500 / (0.012 × 50 × 100)). Frequency estimation: If SPY volatility = 20% annual = 1.26% daily. Daily move ~$5.67 average. Rehedge every ~1.5 days or when delta > ±500. Cost analysis: 10 days with 6-7 rehedges × $15 = $90-$105 total cost. Gamma benefit: Each $10 move generates 0.5 × 0.012 × 10² × 50 × 100 = $300 profit. Cost/benefit: Spend $100 in transaction costs, earn $300+ from gamma = net positive. (3) ACCOUNTING FOR GAMMA CHANGES: Dynamic delta management: Day 0: Delta=0.65, hedge with -22,139 shares. Day 3: SPY moves $450→$465 (+$15). New delta: 0.65 + (0.012 × 15) = 0.83. New options delta exposure: 50 × 100 × 0.83 = 4,150 shares. Change: 4,150 - 3,250 = +900 shares (now under-hedged). Action: Short additional 900 shares to re-establish delta-neutral. Gamma P&L from move: 0.5 × 0.012 × 15² × 50 × 100 = $675 profit locked in. (4) P&L ATTRIBUTION (10 days, 3% move): Scenario: SPY moves from $450 to $463.50 (+3%) over 10 days with 3 swings. DELTA P&L: If perfectly hedged, delta P&L = 0 (by design). Any delta P&L indicates hedge drift between rehedges. Example: Between rehedges, 500 share delta drift × $5 move = $2,500 leakage (should rehedge more frequently). GAMMA P&L: Move 1: $450→$460 (+$10): 0.5 × 0.012 × 10² × 50 × 100 = $300. Move 2: $460→$455 (-$5): 0.5 × 0.012 × 5² × 50 × 100 = $75. Move 3: $455→$463.50 (+$8.50): 0.5 × 0.012 × 8.5² × 50 × 100 = $216.75. Total gamma P&L: $300 + $75 + $216.75 = $591.75. THETA DECAY: -$15/day × 10 days × 50 contracts = -$7,500. VEGA: Assume IV unchanged = $0. NET P&L: Gamma +$591.75 - Theta $7,500 - Transaction costs $100 = -$7,008.25. INTERPRETATION: Realized volatility (3% in 10 days) insufficient to overcome theta. Need higher volatility or shorter holding period. Alternative: If SPY moved ±3% three times (9% total realized vol): Gamma P&L: 0.5 × 0.012 × 13.5² × 50 × 100 × 3 swings = $16,406. Net: +$16,406 - $7,500 - $300 (more rehedges) = +$8,606 (profitable). (5) WHEN TO STOP DELTA-HEDGING: Stop hedging when: Directional conviction: Strong bullish view on SPY due to Fed pivot. Cost of hedging > expected gamma profit. Calculate: If theta = -$7,500 per 10 days and expected gamma from volatility forecast < $7,500, stop hedging and take directional bet. Volatility dried up: If realized vol drops to <15% (from 20%), gamma profits won't cover theta + transaction costs. Market regime change: Correlation breaks down (0.85→0.60), portfolio no longer tracks SPY closely, hedging becomes ineffective. Transition to directional: Reduce hedge by 50% (short only 11,000 shares instead of 22,139). Accept 50% delta exposure as directional bet. Monitor: If market confirms bullish thesis, remove hedge entirely. If wrong, re-establish full hedge. RISK MANAGEMENT: Max unhedged delta: Never exceed 5,000 shares unhedged exposure (0.5% of portfolio). Stop loss on directional bet: If SPY drops 2% ($9) while unhedged, loss = 5,000 × $9 = $45,000. Implement automatic hedge if this occurs.",

    question:
      'Compare the Greek profiles of three volatility strategies: (A) Long straddle, (B) Iron condor, (C) Calendar spread. For each: (1) Calculate all Greeks at initiation, (2) Show how Greeks evolve as expiration approaches, (3) Determine optimal market conditions, (4) Analyze P&L from a 5% stock move with IV spike of 10%, (5) Explain which strategy is best for different volatility forecasts (high realized vs high IV). Use: Stock=$100, 30-day options, IV=25%.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Volatility strategies Greek comparison: SETUP: Stock=$100, 30-day options, IV=25%, r=5%. (A) LONG STRADDLE: Buy $100 call + $100 put. Cost: ~$4.50/share × 100 = $450. Greeks at initiation: Delta: 0 (call +0.50, put -0.50 offset). Gamma: +0.025 (high, peaks at ATM). Theta: -$8/day (losing time value). Vega: +$20 per 1% IV (long volatility). Interpretation: Market-neutral, profits from movement (gamma) or IV spike (vega), loses from time (theta). (B) IRON CONDOR: Buy $90 put, Sell $95 put, Sell $105 call, Buy $110 call. Credit: ~$2.00/share × 100 = $200. Greeks: Delta: 0 (balanced wings). Gamma: -0.008 (short gamma, hurts from big moves). Theta: +$6/day (collecting time decay). Vega: -$15 per 1% IV (short volatility, hurt by IV spike). Interpretation: Profits if stock stays in range ($95-$105), benefits from time decay and IV drop. (C) CALENDAR SPREAD: Buy 60-day $100 call, Sell 30-day $100 call. Debit: ~$1.50/share × 100 = $150. Greeks: Delta: ~0 (both ATM, similar deltas). Gamma: Slightly negative short-term, positive long-term (complex). Theta: +$3/day initially (short-term theta > long-term theta). Vega: +$8 per 1% IV (long back-month vega). Interpretation: Profits from time decay differential and IV rise in back month. (2) GREEKS EVOLUTION AS EXPIRATION APPROACHES: STRADDLE (30 days → 5 days): Gamma: 0.025 → 0.08 (accelerates near expiration, gamma risk). Theta: -$8/day → -$20/day (time decay accelerates, danger zone). Vega: $20 → $8 (less sensitive to IV changes). Risk: Final week, losing $20/day. Need $25+ move to break even (from gamma: 0.5 × 0.08 × 25² = $25). IRON CONDOR: Gamma: -0.008 → -0.025 (short gamma risk increases). Theta: +$6/day → +$12/day (collecting more per day). Vega: -$15 → -$6. Opportunity: If stock stays in range, collect accelerating theta. Close at 7 days to avoid gamma explosion risk. CALENDAR SPREAD: As short leg expires: Theta: +$3/day → +$8/day (short leg loses value faster). Vega: +$8 → +$15 (pure long vega after short expires). Transition: Becomes long call after 30 days. Want stock at $100 (maximize extrinsic value of remaining 30-day call). (3) OPTIMAL MARKET CONDITIONS: STRADDLE best when: Realized vol > implied vol by 5%+ (gamma profits > theta losses). Major event approaching (earnings, Fed, geopolitics). VIX at low levels (15-20) about to spike. Example: Buy before earnings when IV=30%, stock moves 10%, gamma profit $500, theta loss $240 = net +$260. IRON CONDOR best when: Realized vol < implied vol (stock stays calm, collect theta + IV crush). High IV environment (IV=40%) about to normalize to 25%. Range-bound markets (low beta stocks, post-event). Example: Sell after earnings when IV=40% → 25% (-15% IV drop). Vega profit: -$15 vega × -15 IV change = +$225. Theta: +$180 (30 days × $6/day). Net: +$405 if stock in range. CALENDAR SPREAD best when: Expecting IV increase in back month (event beyond short expiration). Moderate movement expected (stock moves to ~$100 at short expiration). Time decay differential profitable (short month theta > long month). Example: 30 days before earnings (60 days out). Short-term IV=25%, long-term IV rises to 35% (+10%). Vega profit: $8 × 10 = +$80. Theta: +$90. Net: +$170. (4) P&L FROM 5% MOVE + 10% IV SPIKE: Scenario: Stock $100→$105 (+$5), IV 25%→35% (+10%). STRADDLE: Gamma P&L: 0.5 × 0.025 × 5² × 100 = +$31.25. Vega P&L: $20 × 10 = +$200. Theta (assume 10 days): -$8 × 10 = -$80. NET: +$31.25 + $200 - $80 = +$151.25 (profit). IRON CONDOR: Gamma P&L: 0.5 × (-0.008) × 5² × 100 = -$10 (stock moved, hurts short gamma). Vega P&L: -$15 × 10 = -$150 (IV spike hurts short vega). Theta: +$6 × 10 = +$60. NET: -$10 - $150 + $60 = -$100 (loss). Stock still in range but IV spike killed position. CALENDAR SPREAD: Gamma P&L: Minimal (~$0, net delta near zero). Vega P&L: +$8 × 10 = +$80 (benefits from IV rise in back month). Theta: +$3 × 10 = +$30. NET: +$80 + $30 = +$110 (profit). WINNER: Straddle (+$151) > Calendar (+$110) > Iron Condor (-$100). (5) STRATEGY SELECTION BY VOLATILITY FORECAST: HIGH REALIZED VOL FORECAST (stock will move >5%): Best: Long straddle. Gamma profits from large moves overcome theta. Example: Forecast 30% realized vol (vs 25% implied). Buy straddle, rehedge delta frequently, profit from gamma scalping. Avoid: Iron condor (short gamma gets hurt). HIGH IMPLIED VOL (IV spike expected): Best: Long straddle or calendar spread. Direct vega exposure profits from IV rise. Example: VIX at 15, expecting spike to 30. Buy straddle: vega $20 × 15 IV increase = +$300 profit. Avoid: Iron condor (short vega loses on IV spike). LOW REALIZED VOL + HIGH IMPLIED VOL: Best: Iron condor or short straddle (if defined risk needed). Collect inflated premiums, profit as IV normalizes and stock stays calm. Example: After earnings, IV=40% (very high), forecast stock calm. Sell iron condor: IV drops to 25% (-15%), collect vega + theta = +$400. Avoid: Long straddle (overpaying for volatility, theta kills). MODERATE VOLATILITY, DIRECTIONAL BIAS: Best: Calendar spread or diagonal spread. Benefit from time decay while maintaining some directional exposure. Example: Stock near $100, expect drift to $105 over 60 days. Use calendar spread, roll short leg as it decays.',

    question:
      'A portfolio has: 100 shares SPY ($450), 10 short $460 calls (delta=-0.40, gamma=-0.015), 5 long $440 puts (delta=-0.35, gamma=0.018).

Include position limits and scenario analysis.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Portfolio Greeks management comprehensive analysis: (1) CURRENT PORTFOLIO GREEKS (SPY=$450): Position 1: 100 shares SPY. Delta: 100 × 1.0 = 100. Gamma: 0 (stock has no gamma). Position 2: 10 short $460 calls. Delta: 10 × 100 × (-0.40) = -400. Gamma: 10 × 100 × (-0.015) = -15. Position 3: 5 long $440 puts. Delta: 5 × 100 × (-0.35) = -175. Gamma: 5 × 100 × 0.018 = 9. TOTAL PORTFOLIO GREEKS: Delta: 100 - 400 - 175 = -475 (short 475 shares equivalent). Gamma: 0 - 15 + 9 = -6 (short gamma, lose from big moves). Dollar exposure: -475 shares × $450 = -$213,750 (net short exposure). Interpretation: Portfolio is net short (delta -475), and short gamma (hurt by volatility). (2) GREEKS AFTER SPY DROPS 5% TO $427.50: Delta changes from gamma: ΔS = $427.50 - $450 = -$22.50. New delta = Old delta + Gamma × ΔS. Stock delta: Still 100 (no change). Short calls: Old delta -400, gamma -15. New delta: -400 + (-15 × -22.50) = -400 + 337.50 = -62.50 (less negative, calls going OTM). Long puts: Old delta -175, gamma 9. New delta: -175 + (9 × -22.50) = -175 - 202.50 = -377.50 (more negative, puts going ITM). NEW PORTFOLIO DELTA: 100 - 62.50 - 377.50 = -340 (still short, but less so). Change: -475 → -340, delta increased by 135 (less short). This is GOOD: Short gamma worked against us (position became less short when we wanted to be short during down move). P&L from this move: Initial position with delta -475: Should gain $475 × $22.50 = $10,687.50. Actual gain (with gamma effects): Roughly $10,000 (gamma slightly reduced gain). Gamma P&L: 0.5 × (-6) × (-22.50)² = -$1,518.75 (lost from short gamma). Net: $10,687.50 - $1,518.75 = $9,168.75. (3) OPTIMAL ADJUSTMENTS FOR DELTA-NEUTRAL, GAMMA-POSITIVE: Current: Delta -475, Gamma -6. Goal: Delta 0, Gamma >0. STEP 1: Neutralize delta. Need: +475 delta exposure. Option A: Buy 475 shares SPY (simple but no gamma). Option B: Buy ATM calls (delta ~0.50, gamma positive). To get +475 delta with calls: 475 / 0.50 / 100 = 9.5 ≈ 10 call contracts. STEP 2: Fix gamma to positive. Buy 10 ATM $450 calls: Delta: 10 × 100 × 0.50 = +500. Gamma: 10 × 100 × 0.020 = +20. NEW PORTFOLIO AFTER BUYING 10 CALLS: Delta: -475 + 500 = +25 (approximately neutral, close enough). Gamma: -6 + 20 = +14 (positive gamma, benefit from volatility). Cost: 10 calls × $100 shares × $8 = $8,000 (approximate ATM call price). ALTERNATIVE ADJUSTMENT: Close short calls (buy them back), this adds delta and gamma. Close 10 short $460 calls: Delta change: Remove -400, add +400. Gamma change: Remove -15, add +15. Remaining position: Stock 100 + Puts -175 = -75 delta. Then buy 1-2 call contracts to neutralize and add gamma. Cheaper option but give up premium collected initially. (4) EXPECTED P&L OVER 7 DAYS (1% daily moves, up-down-up pattern): Assume volatility: 1% daily = $4.50 moves. Pattern: Day 1-2: Up $4.50 × 2 = +$9. Day 3-4: Down $4.50 × 2 = -$9. Day 5-7: Up $4.50 × 3 = +$13.50. Net move: $450 → $463.50 (+$13.50, +3%). Starting position: Delta -475, Gamma -6. DAY 1-2 (UP $9): Delta P&L: -475 × $9 = -$4,275 (lost, we were short). Gamma P&L: 0.5 × (-6) × 9² = -$243 (lost from short gamma). Theta (assume -$50/day for options): -$100 (2 days). Subtotal: -$4,275 - $243 - $100 = -$4,618. DAY 3-4 (DOWN $9): New starting point: $459. Delta approximately -340 (adjusted from gamma). Delta P&L: -340 × (-$9) = +$3,060 (gain, short position). Gamma P&L: 0.5 × (-6) × (-9)² = -$243 (always lose with short gamma). Theta: -$100. Subtotal: +$3,060 - $243 - $100 = +$2,717. DAY 5-7 (UP $13.50): Starting point: $450. Delta approximately -410 (gamma-adjusted). Delta P&L: -410 × $13.50 = -$5,535 (lost). Gamma P&L: 0.5 × (-6) × 13.5² = -$546.75. Theta: -$150. Subtotal: -$5,535 - $546.75 - $150 = -$6,231.75. TOTAL 7-DAY P&L: -$4,618 + $2,717 - $6,231.75 = -$8,132.75. CONCLUSION: Short gamma position loses money even with oscillating moves. Theta collection insufficient to offset gamma losses. Need to neutralize gamma or increase theta collection. (5) RISK MANAGEMENT RULES: CLOSE POSITION WHEN: Max loss threshold: If cumulative loss > $10,000 (2% of hypothetical $500k account). Current path approaching this → close all options, keep stock only. Gamma risk exploding: Within 10 days of expiration, gamma risk grows exponentially. Close all short options at 10 days regardless of P&L. Volatility regime change: If VIX spikes >30 (from <20), short gamma position becomes too risky. Close immediately, accept loss. ADJUST POSITION WHEN: Delta drift >$100,000 notional: If delta drifts from -475 to -800 (additional $150k short exposure). Buy calls or stock to neutralize back to -475. Gamma too negative: If short gamma exceeds -10, add long gamma via ATM straddles. Rolling strategy: As short calls approach expiration, roll to next month higher strike. Collect additional premium, extend time. POSITION LIMITS: Max delta: |Delta| < 1,000 shares ($450k notional, <1% account). Max gamma: |Short gamma| < 20 (limit loss from large moves to $1k per $10 move). Max theta collection: Long theta target +$100/day (balance gamma risk). SCENARIO ANALYSIS: Best case: Stock flat at $450 for 30 days. Collect theta on short calls: 10 contracts × $100 × $2 × 30 days / 365 = ~$164. Puts expire worthless or minimal value. Net: +$164. Worst case: Stock crashes 10% to $405. Delta P&L: -475 × (-$45) = +$21,375 (gain from short). Puts: Gain $35 × 5 × 100 = $17,500 (ITM by $35). Short calls: Expire worthless, keep premium. Net: +$38,875 (hedged well on downside). Actual worst case: Stock rallies 15% to $517.50. Delta P&L: -475 × $67.50 = -$32,062.50 (huge loss). Short calls: Assigned, loss = ($517.50 - $460) × 10 × 100 = -$57,500. Puts: Expire worthless, -$0. Net: -$89,562.50 (catastrophic upside risk). ACTION: Current position has unlimited upside risk from short calls. Need to: (1) Buy back short calls or (2) Buy 1,000 shares to cover (covered calls). (2) Keep puts for downside protection. (3) Avoid naked short call risk.',
