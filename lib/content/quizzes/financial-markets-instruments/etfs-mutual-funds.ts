    question:
      'The data shows that 90%+ of active mutual fund managers underperform passive index funds over 10+ years, yet the active management industry still manages trillions of dollars. Analyze the reasons for this paradox. What behavioral biases and structural factors keep investors in underperforming active funds? For a quantitative engineer, how would you design a system to identify the rare active managers who DO consistently outperform?',
    sampleAnswer: `**Why Active Funds Persist Despite Underperformance:**

**1. Behavioral Biases:**

**Recency Bias:**
- Investors chase last year's winners
- "This fund returned 35% last year!" (ignoring 10-year underperformance)
- Mean reversion ensures yesterday's winners become tomorrow's losers

**Overconfidence:**
- "I can pick the best managers" (most can't)
- "Active management makes sense for MY portfolio" (it doesn't)
- Illusion of control feels better than passive acceptance

**Narrative Fallacy:**
- Good stories beat boring statistics
- "Star manager with proprietary model" > "Cheap index fund"
- Financial media promotes active management (more exciting)

**Loss Aversion:**
- Fear of "missing out" on star manager's gains
- Forget that underperformance is the more likely outcome
- 10% chance of 2% outperformance feels worth 90% chance of 2% underperformance

**2. Structural Factors:**

**Fees and Incentives:**
- Financial advisors earn higher commissions on active funds (0.75%+ expense ratio)
- Passive funds (0.03%) don't generate enough fees
- Conflict of interest: What's best for advisor ≠ what's best for client

**Marketing and Distribution:**
- Active funds spend millions on marketing
- Vanguard doesn't advertise much (doesn't need to)
- Retail investors see ads for "top-performing funds"

**Complexity Bias:**
- "Something this important should be complex" (it shouldn't)
- Passive investing feels "too simple"
- Active management employs smart people with advanced degrees (must be better!)

**Survivorship Bias:**
- Bad active funds close/merge (disappear from statistics)
- Only winners remain visible
- Makes active management look better than it is

**3. When Active Might Make Sense:**

**Inefficient Markets:**
- Small-cap stocks (less analyst coverage)
- International emerging markets
- Corporate bonds (less liquid)
- Not S&P 500 (most efficient market on earth)

**Tax-Loss Harvesting:**
- Active management of individual stocks for tax optimization
- Different from stock-picking active funds

**Key Metrics for Identifying Skill:**

1. **Long track record**: 10+ years (short-term is luck)
2. **Statistical significance**: p < 0.05 (95% confidence alpha is real)
3. **Consistency**: Outperform in 65%+ of rolling 3-year periods
4. **Style stability**: Don't change strategy based on what's working
5. **Capacity**: Does strategy still work with $10B+ AUM? (Most don't scale)
6. **Downside protection**: Outperform in bear markets (not just bull markets)
7. **Fees**: After-fee alpha must be positive

**Reality Check:**
- After these tests, maybe 1-5% of active managers pass
- Even then, past performance ≠ future results
- For most investors: Just buy the index

**Bottom Line**: Active management persists due to behavioral biases, conflicts of interest, and survivorship bias. For engineers building evaluation systems, focus on statistical significance, consistency, and after-fee performance. But honestly? Just buy VOO.`,
