    question:
      'A company is considering restructuring its capital structure. Currently: Market cap $500M, debt $200M at 6% yield, tax rate 25%, unlevered cost of capital 12%. They plan to issue $100M additional debt to repurchase equity. Calculate: (1) Current firm value and WACC, (2) New firm value and WACC after restructuring (assume no financial distress costs), (3) Value created by restructuring, (4) New cost of equity (use MM Prop II with taxes), (5) At what level of debt would financial distress costs likely outweigh tax benefits? Explain the trade-off.',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Complete capital structure analysis: (1) Current situation: Firm value V = E + D = $500M + $200M = $700M. Current WACC: Need cost of equity first. Using MM Prop II (reverse): Current D/E = 200/500 = 0.40. We know RU = 12% (given unlevered cost). Re = RU + (RU - Rd)(1-T)(D/E) = 12% + (12% - 6%)(1-0.25)(0.40) = 12% + 6%(0.75)(0.40) = 12% + 1.8% = 13.8%. WACC = (E/V)Re + (D/V)Rd(1-T) = (500/700)(13.8%) + (200/700)(6%)(0.75) = 71.4%(13.8%) + 28.6%(4.5%) = 9.86% + 1.29% = 11.15%. (2) After restructuring: Additional debt = $100M. New total debt = $300M. Repurchase equity = $100M. New equity value (market) = $500M - $100M = $400M. But wait! Issuing debt creates tax shield value. Tax shield value = T × D = 0.25 × $100M = $25M. New firm value = Old value + Tax shield = $700M + $25M = $725M. New equity = $725M - $300M = $425M (this is market value after restructuring). New D/E = 300/425 = 0.706. New cost of equity: Re = 12% + (12% - 6%)(0.75)(0.706) = 12% + 3.18% = 15.18%. New WACC = (425/725)(15.18%) + (300/725)(6%)(0.75) = 58.6%(15.18%) + 41.4%(4.5%) = 8.90% + 1.86% = 10.76%. (3) Value created: Increase in firm value = $725M - $700M = $25M. This equals the tax shield: T × ΔD = 0.25 × $100M = $25M. All shareholders benefit! Equity holders who don't sell still see value increase. (4) New cost of equity = 15.18% (calculated above). Increased from 13.8% to 15.18% (+1.38%) because financial leverage increased. Higher D/E = higher equity risk. (5) Financial distress threshold: Distress costs become material when: Debt/Value > 50-60% (rule of thumb). Interest coverage < 3x (EBITDA/Interest < 3). Company approaches this when additional debt causes: Credit rating downgrade (BBB+ to BB+). Customers/suppliers lose confidence. Employees leave. Flexibility constrained. For this company: At $300M debt, D/V = 300/725 = 41.4% (still reasonable). Could likely add more debt ($400-450M total, ~60% D/V) before distress costs material. Beyond that point: Marginal benefit of tax shield < Marginal cost of distress. Optimal debt level: Approximately where NPV(tax shield) - PV(distress costs) is maximized. For stable companies: 40-50% D/V. For volatile companies: 20-30% D/V. Key insight: This company increased value by $25M through smart capital structure. But there's a limit—too much debt destroys value through distress costs.",

    question:
      'You are CFO advising on financing a $200M acquisition. Option A: Issue debt at 7% (company currently has D/E = 0.3, would increase to 0.8). Option B: Issue equity (dilute existing shareholders by 15%). Company EBITDA = $150M, current shares = 20M at $80/share, tax rate = 25%. Analyze: (1) Impact on EPS under both scenarios, (2) Breakeven EBIT where both options yield same EPS, (3) Impact on financial flexibility and covenants, (4) Signal to market (pecking order theory), (5) Recommendation with full justification.',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Complete financing decision analysis: (1) EPS analysis: Current situation: Equity value = 20M shares × $80 = $1,600M. Current debt (D/E = 0.3): D = 0.3 × $1,600M = $480M. Current total value = $2,080M. Assume current EBIT = $150M (EBITDA minus D&A, assume D&A = $20M, so EBIT = $130M). Current EPS: Net income = ($130M - $480M × interest rate)(1 - 0.25). Need to estimate current interest rate, assume 6%. Interest = $480M × 6% = $28.8M. Net income = ($130M - $28.8M)(0.75) = $75.9M. Current EPS = $75.9M / 20M = $3.80. Option A (Debt financing): New debt = $480M + $200M = $680M. New D/E = 0.8 (given), so E = $680M/0.8 = $850M. New interest (assume 7% on all debt due to increased risk): Interest = $680M × 7% = $47.6M. Net income = ($130M - $47.6M)(0.75) = $61.8M. EPS (debt) = $61.8M / 20M = $3.09. Option B (Equity financing): New shares = 15% dilution, so total shares = 20M × 1.15 = 23M shares. No additional interest. Net income = ($130M - $28.8M)(0.75) = $75.9M (unchanged). EPS (equity) = $75.9M / 23M = $3.30. Result: Equity financing yields higher EPS ($3.30 vs $3.09). But this assumes static EBIT! (2) Breakeven EBIT: Point where EPS_debt = EPS_equity. (EBIT - I_debt)(1-T)/N_debt = (EBIT - I_current)(1-T)/N_equity. (EBIT - $47.6M)(0.75)/20M = (EBIT - $28.8M)(0.75)/23M. Simplify: (EBIT - 47.6)/20 = (EBIT - 28.8)/23. 23(EBIT - 47.6) = 20(EBIT - 28.8). 23EBIT - 1,094.8 = 20EBIT - 576. 3EBIT = 518.8. EBIT = $172.9M. Interpretation: If EBIT > $172.9M, debt financing gives higher EPS. If EBIT < $172.9M, equity financing gives higher EPS. Current EBIT = $130M < $172.9M, so equity is better for EPS. (3) Financial flexibility: Debt financing (Option A): Pros: No dilution, tax deductible. Cons: Increased D/E to 0.8 (high leverage). Covenants likely tighten (max debt/EBITDA, min interest coverage). Interest coverage = EBITDA/Interest = $150M/$47.6M = 3.15x (getting tight!). Less flexibility for future investments. Higher bankruptcy risk if recession hits. Credit rating may downgrade. Equity financing (Option B): Pros: Maintains financial flexibility. No new debt covenants. Can take on debt later if needed. Lower financial risk. Cons: 15% dilution of existing shareholders. No tax shield benefit. May signal overvaluation (pecking order theory). (4) Market signaling (Pecking Order Theory): Equity issuance signals: Management believes stock is overvalued (why else dilute?). Typically causes 2-3% stock price drop on announcement. Negative signal to market. Debt issuance signals: Management confident in cash flows (can service debt). Stock fairly valued or undervalued. More neutral to positive signal. However, at D/E = 0.8, market may worry about over-leverage. (5) Recommendation: Use HYBRID approach (not purely A or B): Issue $100M debt + $100M equity (50/50 split). Rationale: Balances benefits and risks. New D/E = ($480M + $100M)/$1,600M = 0.36 (moderate increase from 0.3). Maintains financial flexibility. Some tax shield benefit ($100M debt × 7% × 25% tax = $1.75M/year). Less dilution (only 7.5% instead of 15%). Interest coverage = $150M/($28.8M + $7M) = 4.2x (healthy). Alternative: If acquisition highly strategic and certain to succeed: Use debt (Option A) if acquisition will significantly boost EBITDA. If EBITDA increases to $200M+, EBIT will exceed $172.9M breakeven. Debt financing becomes EPS accretive. If acquisition risky or uncertain: Use equity (Option B) to maintain flexibility. Can't risk financial distress if deal goes wrong. Final recommendation: Hybrid financing (50% debt, 50% equity) provides optimal balance. Revisit after 2 years if EBITDA grows as expected—can then optimize capital structure with refinancing.",

    question:
      'Compare capital structures of two companies in same industry: Company A (Tech): 10% debt, 90% equity, beta = 1.1, ROIC = 25%, growth = 15%. Company B (Tech): 40% debt, 60% equity, beta = 1.6, ROIC = 18%, growth = 8%. Both are profitable. Using trade-off theory and pecking order theory, explain: (1) Why do their capital structures differ so dramatically?, (2) Calculate unlevered betas for both (tax rate 20%), (3) Which company has more financial risk and why?, (4) Which structure is "better" and for what type of business?, (5) How would recession impact each differently?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Comparative capital structure analysis: (1) Why structures differ: Company A (low leverage, 10% debt): High growth (15%) needs financial flexibility. Likely uses internal funds first (pecking order). Intangible assets (software, IP) provide poor collateral. Volatile cash flows in growth phase. No need for tax shield (may not be profitable historically). Example: Amazon, Google early days. Company B (higher leverage, 40% debt): Mature, slower growth (8%). Stable, predictable cash flows. Can service debt obligations. Uses debt for tax shield (profitable at 18% ROIC). Returning cash to shareholders (dividends + buybacks). Example: Microsoft today, Oracle. Trade-off theory explains both: Company A: Costs of distress > Benefits of tax shield. Growth options very valuable. Financial distress would destroy growth opportunities. Optimal debt = low. Company B: Benefits of tax shield > Costs of distress. Mature, stable business. Low probability of distress. Optimal debt = moderate-high. (2) Unlevered betas: Company A: βL = 1.1, D/E = 10/90 = 0.111, T = 20%. βU = βL / [1 + (1-T)(D/E)] = 1.1 / [1 + 0.80(0.111)] = 1.1 / 1.089 = 1.010. Company B: βL = 1.6, D/E = 40/60 = 0.667, T = 20%. βU = 1.6 / [1 + 0.80(0.667)] = 1.6 / 1.534 = 1.043. Insight: Unlevered betas almost identical (1.010 vs 1.043)! Similar business risk. But Company B\'s levered beta much higher (1.6 vs 1.1) due to financial leverage. Financial risk (leverage) explains difference, not business risk. (3) Financial risk comparison: Company B has more financial risk: Levered beta 1.6 vs 1.1 (equity 45% more volatile). D/E ratio 0.667 vs 0.111 (6x more leverage). Must service debt regardless of performance. Less flexibility in recession. However: Company B\'s ROIC (18%) > Cost of debt (assume 6-7%). Leverage amplifies ROE positively in good times. Interest coverage likely healthy: If EBITDA/Assets = 15%, and D/A = 40%, Interest coverage = EBITDA/Interest = (15% × Assets)/(6% × 40% × Assets) = 15%/2.4% = 6.25x (very healthy). So financial risk is manageable given stability. Company A has minimal financial risk but lower ROE leverage. (4) Which structure is better?: Depends on business characteristics: Company A structure (low debt) better for: High growth companies (need flexibility). Volatile cash flows. Intangible-heavy businesses. Early stage companies. Technology R&D businesses. Example: SaaS startups, biotech. Company B structure (higher debt) better for: Mature, stable businesses. Predictable cash flows. Asset-heavy businesses (collateral). Low growth, high profitability. Where ROIC >> Cost of debt. Example: Software maintenance businesses, ERP vendors. Neither is universally "better"—optimal structure depends on firm characteristics. (5) Recession impact: Company A (low leverage): Pros: Flexibility to weather downturn. No debt service pressure. Can invest in opportunities (acquire distressed competitors). Maintain R&D spending. Cons: If growth stalls, high valuation compresses. Stock price may fall more (high beta to begin with). Company B (higher leverage): Pros: Debt is fixed obligation—if survives, equity holders benefit on recovery. Potentially buys back stock cheaply. Cons: Debt service pressure if revenues fall. May breach covenants. Forced to cut investment, dividend. High beta (1.6) magnifies stock volatility. Potential distress if recession severe. Risk of credit downgrade → higher interest rates. Quantitative example: Assume revenues drop 30% in recession: Company A: Can cut costs, survive with cash reserves. No bankruptcy risk. May even gain market share. Company B: If EBITDA drops 30% and interest coverage falls from 6x to 4x, still manageable. But if drops 50%, coverage becomes 3x (tight). Covenants may breach. Bottom line: Company A structure safer in recession. Company B structure riskier but generates higher ROE in good times. Key lesson: Capital structure should match business model. Growing, volatile businesses → low leverage. Stable, mature businesses → can handle higher leverage. One size does not fit all.',
    keyPoints: [
      'Structures differ: A (growth, volatile) uses low leverage; B (mature, stable) uses higher leverage',
      'Unlevered betas similar (~1.0), showing similar business risk despite different leverage',

      'Neither structure universally better—depends on growth, volatility, asset tangibility, profitability',
      'Recession: Company A (low debt) more flexible, Company B (high debt) faces covenant pressure',
