        question:
            'Company has 100M shares at $40/share, $300M net income. Plans to distribute $100M: Option A (Dividend): Pay $1/share dividend. Option B (Buyback): Repurchase shares at $40. Tax rates: 20% on dividends, 15% on capital gains. Calculate: (1) EPS and P/E before distribution, (2) EPS and implied stock price after buyback (assume P/E constant), (3) After-tax value to shareholder from dividend, (4) After-tax value to shareholder from buyback (if they sell proportional shares), (5) Which is more beneficial and why?',
        sampleAnswer:
            'Complete dividend vs buyback comparison: (1) Before distribution: EPS = $300M / 100M shares = $3.00. Stock price = $40. P/E = $40 / $3.00 = 13.33×. (2) Option B (Buyback): Shares repurchased = $100M / $40 = 2.5M shares. New shares outstanding = 100M - 2.5M = 97.5M. New EPS = $300M / 97.5M = $3.077. Implied stock price (constant P/E): Price = EPS × P/E = $3.077 × 13.33 = $41.03. Price increases from $40.00 to $41.03 (+2.56%). (3) Option A (Dividend after tax): Dividend per share = $1.00. Tax = 20% × $1.00 = $0.20. After-tax dividend = $0.80 per share. Stock price after dividend = $40 - $1 = $39 (ex-dividend). Total value = $39 stock + $0.80 cash = $39.80. (4) Option B (Buyback after tax): Shareholder owns 1 share initially worth $40. After buyback, stock worth $41.03. Shareholder doesn\'t sell: Unrealized gain = $1.03 (no tax yet!). If shareholder sells proportionally (2.5% of holdings to maintain same dollar position): Sale proceeds = $41.03 × 0.025 = $1.026. Cost basis = $40 × 0.025 = $1.00. Capital gain = $1.026 - $1.00 = $0.026. Tax = 15% × $0.026 = $0.004. After-tax proceeds = $1.026 - $0.004 = $1.022. Remaining holding = 0.975 shares × $41.03 = $40.00. Total value = $40.00 + $1.022 = $41.02. (5) Comparison: Dividend (after tax): $39.80. Buyback (after tax): $41.02. Buyback advantage: $41.02 - $39.80 = $1.22 per share (3.05% better!). Why buyback is better: Lower tax rate (15% vs 20%). Tax deferred (only pay if sell). Mechanically increases EPS (+2.56%). Stock price increases (constant P/E assumption). All shareholders benefit, but only sellers pay tax immediately. Dividend disadvantage: Immediate tax at higher rate. Forced distribution (no choice). Stock drops by dividend amount (ex-dividend). Additional considerations: If shareholder doesn\'t sell after buyback, gains $1.03 unrealized (tax-free until sold). Buyback gives shareholder optionality (can choose when to realize gain). Dividend provides current income (preference for retirees). Buyback more flexible for company (can stop anytime). Bottom line: Buyback is more tax-efficient for most shareholders, especially in taxable accounts. Dividend better for income-focused investors and in tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs).',

        question:
            'Company has earnings yield of 6% (E/P ratio), cost of equity is 10%. They have $500M excess cash. Should they: (a) Buy back shares, (b) Invest in project with 8% IRR, (c) Pay special dividend, (d) Hold cash. Analyze each option using NPV framework and recommend optimal use of cash. What changes if earnings yield is 12% instead of 6%?',
        sampleAnswer:
            'Complete capital allocation decision analysis: Key principle: Invest in projects with return > cost of capital. Return cash if no better opportunities. (a) Buy back shares: Earnings yield = 6%. Cost of equity = 10%. Buying back shares "earns" 6% (accretive to EPS). But cost of capital is 10%. NPV = -$500M + $500M × (0.06 / 0.10) = -$500M + $300M = -$200M. Destroys $200M of value! At 6% earnings yield, stock is overvalued. Buying back at overvalued price destroys shareholder value. (b) Invest in project (8% IRR): Project IRR = 8%. Cost of capital = 10%. NPV = -$500M + PV(future cash flows at 10%). If IRR = 8% < WACC = 10%, then NPV < 0. Destroys value (estimated ~-$100M NPV). Don\'t invest in negative-NPV projects. (c) Pay special dividend: Distributes cash to shareholders at no value creation/destruction. Shareholders receive $500M (minus taxes). They can reinvest themselves at market rates. Neutral to slightly negative (due to dividend taxes). (d) Hold cash: Earn risk-free rate (assume 4%). Return = 4%. Cost of capital = 10%. Opportunity cost = 10% - 4% = 6% per year. Destroys value over time (cash drag). Recommendation (6% earnings yield): Pay special dividend (option c). Rationale: Stock overvalued (E/P = 6% << 10% cost of equity). Buying back destroys $200M value. No positive-NPV projects available (8% IRR << 10% WACC). Holding cash destroys value (4% return << 10% cost). Special dividend returns cash for shareholders to redeploy. If earnings yield is 12% (instead of 6%): Earnings yield = 12%. Cost of equity = 10%. Stock is undervalued (12% > 10%). (a) Buy back shares: NPV = -$500M + $500M × (0.12 / 0.10) = -$500M + $600M = +$100M. Creates $100M of value! When stock undervalued, buybacks are accretive and NPV-positive. (b) Invest in project (8% IRR): Still NPV-negative (8% < 10%). Don\'t invest. (c) Pay dividend: Neutral (but gives up opportunity to buy undervalued stock). (d) Hold cash: Still destroys value (4% << 10%). Recommendation (12% earnings yield): Buy back shares aggressively! Stock trading at 12% earnings yield implies valuation of 8.33× P/E. If cost of equity is 10%, fair value is 10× P/E. Stock is 17% undervalued. Buying back creates immediate value. Every $1 spent buying back returns $1.20 in value (12% yield / 10% cost). Key decision rule: Earnings yield > Cost of equity → Buy back shares (creates value). Earnings yield < Cost of equity → Don\'t buy back (destroys value). Positive-NPV projects > Cost of capital → Invest (priority over buyback). If no good projects and stock fairly valued → Dividend. If no good projects and stock undervalued → Buyback. Bottom line: Capital allocation depends on relative returns. Always compare: Buyback return (earnings yield), Project returns (IRR), Cost of capital (hurdle rate). Invest where returns exceed opportunity cost. When in doubt, return cash to shareholders (they can allocate themselves).',

        question:
            'Company announces quarterly dividend increase from $0.50 to $0.60 (+20%). Stock jumps 3% on announcement. Using signaling theory and dividend discount model: (1) What signal does this send?, (2) If cost of equity is 12% and dividends expected to grow at 6% perpetually, what is implied fair value before and after increase?, (3) Stock was $40 before announcement, now $41.20. Is stock overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued?, (4) What would happen if company CUT dividend from $0.50 to $0.40?, (5) Why are dividends "sticky" in practice?',
        sampleAnswer:
            'Complete dividend signal and valuation analysis: (1) Signal from 20% dividend increase: Positive signals: Management confidence in sustainable earnings growth. Strong future cash flow visibility. Profitable, cash-generative business. Commitment to shareholder returns. Company reaching maturity (shifting to higher payout). Potential strategic pivot (less growth capex needed). Market interpretation: Bullish signal → stock rallies 3%. Analysts may upgrade earnings estimates. Credit rating may improve (strong cash flows). Investors anticipate continued dividend growth. (2) Gordon Growth Model valuation: Before increase: Quarterly dividend = $0.50. Annual dividend = $0.50 × 4 = $2.00. Next year dividend (D_1) = $2.00 × 1.06 = $2.12. Fair value = D_1 / (r - g) = $2.12 / (0.12 - 0.06) = $2.12 / 0.06 = $35.33. After increase: New quarterly dividend = $0.60. New annual dividend = $0.60 × 4 = $2.40. Next year dividend = $2.40 × 1.06 = $2.544. Fair value = $2.544 / (0.12 - 0.06) = $2.544 / 0.06 = $42.40. (3) Valuation assessment: Stock price before announcement: $40.00. DDM fair value before: $35.33. Stock was trading at 13.2% premium (already pricing in some growth). Stock price after announcement: $41.20. DDM fair value after: $42.40. Stock now slightly undervalued: $42.40 - $41.20 = $1.20 (2.8% upside). Conclusion: Stock is slightly undervalued post-announcement. Fair value increased $7.07 ($42.40 - $35.33) due to: Higher base dividend ($2.40 vs $2.00). Same 6% growth rate on larger base (compounding effect). Stock only increased $1.20 (3%), hasn\'t fully priced in new dividend trajectory. Potential buying opportunity if fundamentals support new dividend level. (4) Dividend cut scenario: If dividend cut from $0.50 to $0.40 (-20%): Negative signals: Earnings/cash flow deteriorating. Management lacks confidence in sustainability. Potential financial distress ahead. May breach debt covenants. Strategic challenges (competitive pressure). Likely stock reaction: Stock drops 5-15% (far more than 20% dividend cut!). Analysts downgrade (cut earnings estimates). Institutional holders may sell (dividend mandate). Credit rating downgrade risk. Shareholder lawsuits possible (fiduciary duty questions). Quantitative impact: New annual dividend = $0.40 × 4 = $1.60. Next year = $1.60 × 1.06 = $1.696 (assume same 6% growth, generous). Fair value = $1.696 / 0.06 = $28.27. Stock would likely fall to $25-30 range (below fair value due to loss of confidence). (5) Why dividends are "sticky": Management perspective: Dividend cuts send terrible signal (last resort). Embarrassing, damages reputation. Prefer stable/growing dividends (reliable shareholder base). Cut dividends = admit you made a mistake (overestimated earnings power). Rational inertia: Shareholders expect consistency. Institutional investors screen for dividend growers. Dividend aristocrats (25+ years of increases) trade at premiums. Cost of cutting > benefit of retaining cash. Behavioral factors: Loss aversion (cutting feels worse than not increasing). Anchoring (previous dividend becomes reference point). Herding (don\'t want to be first in industry to cut). Career risk for CFO/CEO (market punishes cutters). Empirical evidence: Companies increase dividends gradually. Maintain dividends even during recessions (if possible). Cut only when absolutely necessary (financial distress). Prefer share buybacks for flexibility (can stop without signal). Historical data: Dividend cuts → stock drops 5-10% on average. Dividend increases → stock rises 1-3%. Asymmetric reaction (cuts hurt more than increases help). Practical policy: Under-promise, over-deliver. Set dividend low enough to sustain through downturns. Use buybacks for excess cash (flexible). Raise dividend only when confident in sustainability. Bottom line: Dividends are powerful signal. Increases = good news, cuts = disaster. Once set, difficult to reduce. This stickiness makes dividend policy highly consequential.',
