    question:
      'PE firm buys company for $1,000M (40% equity = $400M, 60% debt = $600M). Over 5 years: EBITDA grows from $100M to $150M, debt pays down to $100M. Exit at 10× EBITDA multiple. Calculate: (1) Exit enterprise value, (2) Exit equity value, (3) MOIC, (4) Approximate IRR, (5) Value creation bridge (decompose return into EBITDA growth, multiple expansion, deleveraging). Entry multiple was 10× ($1,000M / $100M).',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Complete LBO return analysis: Given: Purchase price = $1,000M. Entry EBITDA = $100M. Entry multiple = 10× ($1,000M / $100M). Equity invested = $400M. Initial debt = $600M. Exit (Year 5): EBITDA = $150M, Debt = $100M, Exit multiple = 10×. (1) Exit enterprise value: Exit EV = Exit EBITDA × Exit multiple = $150M × 10 = $1,500M. (2) Exit equity value: Exit equity = Exit EV - Exit debt = $1,500M - $100M = $1,400M. (3) MOIC (Multiple of Invested Capital): MOIC = Exit equity / Equity invested = $1,400M / $400M = 3.5×. PE firm turns $400M into $1,400M (3.5× money). (4) Approximate IRR: Rule of thumb: 2× in 5 years ≈ 15% IRR. 3× in 5 years ≈ 25% IRR. 4× in 5 years ≈ 32% IRR. 3.5× is between 3× and 4×, so IRR ≈ 28-29%. Precise calculation: IRR is the rate where: -$400M (Year 0) + $1,400M / (1+IRR)^5 = 0. $1,400M / (1+IRR)^5 = $400M. (1+IRR)^5 = 3.5. 1+IRR = 3.5^(1/5) = 1.2851. IRR = 28.5%. (5) Value creation bridge: Entry equity value = Entry EV - Initial debt = $1,000M - $600M = $400M. Exit equity value = $1,400M. Total return = $1,400M - $400M = $1,000M. Decompose into three sources: (a) EBITDA Growth: EBITDA increased from $100M to $150M (+$50M). Value from EBITDA growth (holding entry multiple constant) = ΔEBITDA × Entry multiple = $50M × 10 = $500M. (b) Multiple Expansion: Entry multiple = 10×, Exit multiple = 10×. Multiple expansion = 0× (no change). Value from multiple expansion = Exit EBITDA × Δ Multiple = $150M × (10 - 10) = $0M. (c) Deleveraging: Debt paid down from $600M to $100M = $500M reduction. Value from deleveraging = $500M. Check: Total = $500M (EBITDA) + $0M (multiple) + $500M (deleveraging) = $1,000M ✓. Interpretation: EBITDA growth: 50% of return (\$500M). Contributed by operational improvements (revenue growth, cost cuts). Multiple expansion: 0% of return. Bought at 10×, sold at 10× (no market timing benefit). Deleveraging: 50% of return (\$500M). Used cash flow to pay down debt, converting debt to equity value. Financial engineering at work! Key insight: Half the return came from operations (EBITDA growth), half from leverage (debt paydown). This is textbook LBO—use debt to amplify equity returns. Without leverage (all-equity purchase): Would invest $1,000M, exit with $1,500M EV (no debt). Return = $500M / $1,000M = 50% total (8.4% IRR). With leverage: Invest $400M, exit with $1,400M equity. Return = $1,000M / $400M = 250% total (28.5% IRR). Leverage amplifies returns 3.4×! But also amplifies risk—if EBITDA declined instead, equity could be wiped out.',

    question:
      'Evaluate LBO candidate: Company has $200M revenue, $50M EBITDA (25% margin), $10M CapEx, generates $35M FCF annually. Market trades at 8× EBITDA. Can support max 5× Debt/EBITDA (banks will lend $250M). PE firm targets 25% IRR, 5-year hold, assume exit at 8× EBITDA. Questions: (1) What is max purchase price? (2) What equity check required (at max leverage)? (3) To achieve 25% IRR, what exit equity value needed? (4) What EBITDA must reach by Year 5 (assuming exit at 8×, debt pays down $150M)? (5) Is this a good LBO candidate and why?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Complete LBO candidate evaluation: Current financials: Revenue = $200M, EBITDA = $50M (25% margin), CapEx = $10M, FCF = $35M. Market multiple = 8× EBITDA. Max leverage = 5× Debt/EBITDA. (1) Max purchase price: At 8× market multiple: Purchase price = 8 × $50M = $400M. (2) Equity check at max leverage: Max debt = 5× EBITDA = 5 × $50M = $250M. Equity required = Purchase price - Debt = $400M - $250M = $150M. Leverage = 62.5% debt, 37.5% equity (aggressive but typical for PE). (3) Exit equity value for 25% IRR: Target IRR = 25%. Holding period = 5 years. Exit equity = Initial equity × (1 + IRR)^Years = $150M × (1.25)^5 = $150M × 3.05 = $457.5M ≈ $458M. To achieve 25% IRR, need $458M equity value at exit (3.05× MOIC). (4) Required exit EBITDA: Exit equity value = $458M. Debt paid down $150M over 5 years: Exit debt = $250M - $150M = $100M. Exit enterprise value = Exit equity + Exit debt = $458M + $100M = $558M. At 8× exit multiple: Exit EBITDA = Exit EV / Multiple = $558M / 8 = $69.75M ≈ $70M. Company must grow EBITDA from $50M to $70M (+40% or 7% CAGR). (5) Is this a good LBO candidate?: Analysis: Strengths: Strong cash generation: $35M FCF/$50M EBITDA = 70% conversion (excellent!). Low CapEx: $10M (20% of EBITDA) → high FCF for debt paydown. Healthy margin: 25% EBITDA margin (attractive). Reasonable leverage: 5× Debt/EBITDA manageable with $35M FCF. Interest coverage: Assume 7% interest → $250M × 7% = $17.5M interest. Coverage = $50M EBITDA / $17.5M = 2.9× (acceptable, >2× threshold). Modest growth required: 7% CAGR EBITDA growth achievable for stable business. Concerns: Need more information: Customer concentration? Top 3 customers > 50% revenue = red flag. Industry dynamics? Mature, stable industry (good) vs. disruption risk (bad). Management quality? Can they execute operational improvements? Cyclicality? Recession-proof business model or cyclical exposure? Capital structure after debt paydown: Exit debt = $100M. Exit EV = $558M. Exit D/V = $100M/$558M = 18% (comfortable, delevered). Feasibility of $70M EBITDA: Current = $50M. Target = $70M (+$20M over 5 years). Sources of growth: Revenue growth: 5% CAGR → $255M Year 5 revenue. If margin maintained (25%), EBITDA = $64M (close!). Margin expansion: 25% → 27.5% on $255M = $70M (achievable with cost cuts). Combination: 4% revenue CAGR + 2% margin expansion = $70M EBITDA. Realistic if management executes. Conclusion: Appears to be a good LBO candidate IF: Industry is stable (not disruptive). Management can execute (revenue growth + cost cuts). No major customer concentration or regulatory risks. Business not highly cyclical. Cash flow generation is excellent (\$35M FCF). Leverage is manageable (5× entry, 1.4× exit). Growth requirements modest (7% CAGR). Returns attractive (25% IRR target). Recommendation: Proceed to due diligence. Focus on: Customer/supplier concentration. Competitive dynamics. Management capabilities. Cyclicality assessment. If these check out, strong candidate for LBO.',

    question:
      'PE firm model shows: Scenario A (Bull): Exit at 12× EBITDA, 30% IRR. Scenario B (Base): Exit at 10× EBITDA, 22% IRR. Scenario C (Bear): Exit at 7× EBITDA, 10% IRR. Entry at 9× EBITDA, 5-year hold, initial equity $500M. Calculate: (1) Exit equity value in each scenario, (2) Implied exit EBITDA (assume debt constant at $800M), (3) What drove the different returns?, (4) Which scenario should PE firm base decision on?, (5) What return hurdle should PE firm require?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Complete LBO scenario analysis: Given: Entry multiple = 9× EBITDA. Holding period = 5 years. Initial equity = $500M. Exit debt = $800M (assume constant for simplicity). Three scenarios with different exit multiples and IRRs. (1) Exit equity value in each scenario: IRR formula: Exit equity = Initial equity × (1 + IRR)^Years. Scenario A (Bull): 30% IRR. Exit equity = $500M × (1.30)^5 = $500M × 3.71 = $1,855M. Scenario B (Base): 22% IRR. Exit equity = $500M × (1.22)^5 = $500M × 2.70 = $1,350M. Scenario C (Bear): 10% IRR. Exit equity = $500M × (1.10)^5 = $500M × 1.61 = $805M. (2) Implied exit EBITDA: Exit equity + Exit debt = Exit enterprise value. Exit EV / Exit multiple = Exit EBITDA. Scenario A: Exit EV = $1,855M + $800M = $2,655M. Exit EBITDA = $2,655M / 12 = $221M. Scenario B: Exit EV = $1,350M + $800M = $2,150M. Exit EBITDA = $2,150M / 10 = $215M. Scenario C: Exit EV = $805M + $800M = $1,605M. Exit EBITDA = $1,605M / 7 = $229M. Interesting! Scenario C (Bear) requires HIGHEST exit EBITDA (\$229M). But has LOWEST return (10% IRR). Why? Because exit multiple is lowest (7×). Multiple compression kills returns despite strong operations. (3) What drove different returns?: Entry EV = Entry equity + Entry debt = $500M + $800M = $1,300M. Entry EBITDA = $1,300M / 9 = $144M. Return decomposition: Scenario A (Bull, 30% IRR): EBITDA growth: $144M → $221M (+53%). Multiple expansion: 9× → 12× (+33%). Both strong. Scenario B (Base, 22% IRR): EBITDA growth: $144M → $215M (+49%). Multiple expansion: 9× → 10× (+11%). Modest multiple expansion. Scenario C (Bear, 10% IRR): EBITDA growth: $144M → $229M (+59%, best operationally!). Multiple compression: 9× → 7× (-22%). Despite strongest operational performance (+59% EBITDA), multiple compression destroys returns. Key insight: Multiple expansion/compression is the dominant driver of returns variance. Operational performance similar across scenarios (EBITDA +49-59%). But multiples range from 7× to 12× (creates 20% IRR spread!). Market timing/valuation matters as much as (or more than) operations. (4) Which scenario to base decision on?: Never use Bull case for go/no-go decision. Too optimistic. Risk of overpaying or taking undue risk. Use Base case for valuation and decision. 22% IRR is strong (above typical 20% PE hurdle). Represents realistic assumptions. Use Bear case for downside protection. 10% IRR is acceptable minimum (covers cost of capital). Check: Can survive if bear case plays out? At $805M exit equity, still profitable (\$305M gain). If bear case led to losses (\$500M → $300M), deal too risky. Decision framework: Base case IRR ≥ 25% → Strong deal, proceed. Base case IRR = 20-25% → Good deal, proceed if bear case acceptable. Base case IRR < 20% → Weak deal, pass unless unique strategic rationale. Bear case IRR ≥ 10% → Downside protected. Bear case IRR < 0% → Avoid (risk of total loss). This deal: Base 22% (good), Bear 10% (acceptable). Recommendation: Proceed. (5) What return hurdle should PE firm require?: Standard PE hurdle: 20-25% IRR. Reflects: 10-year risk-free rate (4%). Equity risk premium (7-8%). Illiquidity premium (3-4%). Operational/execution risk (3-5%). Management fees (2%). Total: 20-25% required return. Context-specific adjustments: Lower-risk LBO (stable, mature): 18-20% IRR acceptable. Higher-risk LBO (cyclical, turnaround): 25-30% IRR required. Large-cap LBO (>$1B): 18-22% IRR (harder to add value at scale). Small-cap LBO (<$500M): 25-30% IRR (higher risk, less liquidity). For this deal: Base case 22% IRR exceeds standard 20% hurdle. Bear case 10% IRR provides downside protection. Deal is attractive. Risk: Heavily dependent on exit multiple. If market crashes at exit (7× or lower), returns severely impacted. Mitigation: Hold flexibility (extend hold period if multiple low). Dividend recapitalization (take cash out earlier). Operational improvements (less dependent on multiple expansion). Bottom line: Use base case for decision (22% IRR ✓). Verify bear case is acceptable (10% IRR ✓). Require 20-25% base case IRR hurdle. This deal clears all bars—proceed.',
