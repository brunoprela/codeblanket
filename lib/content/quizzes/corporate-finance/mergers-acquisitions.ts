    question:
      'Acquirer (value $10B) bids for Target (standalone value $2B) at $2.8B (40% premium). Expected synergies: $600M. Integration costs: $100M. Calculate: (1) Combined value post-synergies, (2) Total value created, (3) Value to target shareholders, (4) Value to acquirer shareholders, (5) Should acquirer proceed? What premium would make deal NPV-neutral?',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Complete M&A value analysis: (1) Combined value post-synergies: Combined value = Acquirer + Target + Synergies - Integration costs = $10B + $2B + $0.6B - $0.1B = $12.5B. (2) Total value created: Total value = Combined value - Standalone values = $12.5B - ($10B + $2B) = $0.5B ($500M created). (3) Value to target shareholders: Premium paid = $2.8B - $2.0B = $0.8B ($800M). Target shareholders capture $800M value from: Premium above standalone ($800M). They don't care about synergies—they're selling! (4) Value to acquirer shareholders: Value to acquirer = Combined value - Acquirer standalone - Price paid = $12.5B - $10B - $2.8B = -$0.3B (-$300M). Acquirer DESTROYS $300M value! Why? Total value created = $500M (synergies - integration). Premium paid = $800M. Premium > value created → acquirer overpaid by $300M. (5) Decision: Should REJECT deal. Acquirer paying $800M premium for $500M net synergies. Alternative: Negotiate lower price or walk away. Breakeven analysis: For NPV = 0 to acquirer: Value to acquirer = Combined value - Acquirer standalone - Price = 0. $12.5B - $10B - Price = 0. Price = $2.5B. Breakeven premium = ($2.5B - $2.0B) / $2.0B = 25%. At 25% premium ($2.5B price): Target gets $500M value (25% premium). Acquirer gets $0 value (breakeven). Total value ($500M) exactly split: 100% to target, 0% to acquirer. This is SELLER'S perspective (target maximizes). For deal to make sense for acquirer: Should pay < $2.5B (< 25% premium). Example: At 20% premium ($2.4B price): Value to acquirer = $12.5B - $10B - $2.4B = +$100M (creates value). Value to target = $400M (premium). Total = $500M (fully captured). Key insight: In competitive auction, target captures most value. Acquirer must be disciplined—walk if premium > net synergies.",

    question:
      'Analyze EPS accretion/dilution: Acquirer: 100M shares, $300M earnings, EPS = $3.00, P/E = 20×, stock = $60. Target: 50M shares, $100M earnings, EPS = $2.00, P/E = 15×, stock = $30. Scenarios: (A) All-stock at 0.50× exchange ratio, (B) All-cash at $40/share (debt-financed at 6% rate, 25% tax). Calculate pro forma EPS for both scenarios and explain which is more accretive. Is EPS accretion the right metric for decision-making?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Complete accretion/dilution analysis: Current state: Acquirer: 100M shares, $300M NI, EPS = $3.00, Stock = $60. Target: 50M shares, $100M NI, EPS = $2.00, Stock = $30. Scenario A (All-Stock): Exchange ratio = 0.50× (target shareholders get 0.5 acquirer shares per target share). New shares issued = 50M × 0.50 = 25M shares. Pro forma shares = 100M + 25M = 125M. Pro forma NI = $300M + $100M = $400M (no interest expense). Pro forma EPS = $400M / 125M = $3.20. EPS change = $3.20 - $3.00 = +$0.20 (+6.7% accretive). Scenario B (All-Cash): Cash required = 50M shares × $40/share = $2,000M ($2B). Assume debt-financed entirely at 6%. Annual interest = $2,000M × 6% = $120M. Tax shield = $120M × 25% = $30M. After-tax interest = $120M - $30M = $90M. Pro forma NI = $300M + $100M - $90M = $310M. Pro forma shares = 100M (no dilution). Pro forma EPS = $310M / 100M = $3.10. EPS change = $3.10 - $3.00 = +$0.10 (+3.3% accretive). Comparison: Stock deal (A): +6.7% accretive (EPS = $3.20). Cash deal (B): +3.3% accretive (EPS = $3.10). Stock deal MORE accretive. Why? In stock deal: Acquirer "buys" target at its P/E (20×). Acquirer effectively pays: 25M shares × $60 = $1,500M. But target only worth: $30 × 50M = $1,500M (market value). Fair exchange. Since acquirer P/E (20×) > target P/E (15×), stock deal accretive. Acquirer arbitrages P/E multiple. In cash deal: Acquirer pays $40/share (33% premium). Total = $2B (vs $1.5B market value). Overpays by $500M. Higher interest expense offsets earnings. But: No dilution. Is EPS accretion the right metric?: NO! EPS accretion is NOT the same as value creation. Problems with EPS focus: Ignores risk (leverage in cash deal increases risk). Ignores growth (combined company growth prospects?). Ignores ROIC (what returns on acquired assets?). Can buy low-quality, low-P/E company and be "accretive" but destroy value. Correct metrics: NPV: Does deal create value (synergies > premium)? ROIC: Does acquisition earn above cost of capital? IRR: What\'s the return on investment? Example: Stock deal is MORE accretive (6.7% vs 3.3%). But if acquirer overpays by issuing expensive stock, destroys long-term value. Cash deal is LESS accretive. But if debt is cheap and synergies strong, creates more value. Bottom line: EPS accretion is easy to calculate and communicate (CFOs love it). But it\'s a flawed metric—can be gamed. Always focus on intrinsic value creation, not accounting metrics.',

    question:
      'Company A ($5B value, 10× EV/EBITDA) acquires Company B for 12× EV/EBITDA. Company B EBITDA = $200M. After acquisition, revenue synergies add $50M EBITDA, cost synergies save $30M, but integration costs $100M (one-time). Using comparable multiple (10×), calculate: (1) Price paid for Company B, (2) Standalone value of Company B at 10× (if traded independently), (3) Value of synergies, (4) Net value created, (5) Explain why Company A paid 12× when market multiples are 10×.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Complete M&A multiple analysis: Given: Company A value = $5B at 10× EV/EBITDA. Company B EBITDA = $200M. Acquisition multiple = 12× EV/EBITDA. Revenue synergies = +$50M EBITDA. Cost synergies = +$30M EBITDA. Integration costs = $100M (one-time). (1) Price paid for Company B: Price = EBITDA × Multiple = $200M × 12 = $2,400M ($2.4B). Company A pays $2.4B to acquire Company B. (2) Standalone value (at 10× market multiple): If Company B traded independently at market 10× multiple: Value = $200M × 10 = $2,000M ($2B). Company B intrinsic standalone value = $2B. (3) Value of synergies: Revenue synergies: $50M EBITDA. Cost synergies: $30M EBITDA. Total synergies: $50M + $30M = $80M EBITDA. Value of synergies (at 10× multiple) = $80M × 10 = $800M. Less integration costs: $800M - $100M = $700M net synergy value. (4) Net value created: Combined value = A + B + Synergies - Integration = $5B + $2B + $0.8B - $0.1B = $7.7B. Standalone sum = $5B + $2B = $7B. Total value created = $7.7B - $7B = $700M. Value distribution: Price paid = $2.4B. Company B standalone = $2.0B. Premium to Company B = $2.4B - $2.0B = $400M. Company B shareholders capture $400M. Value to Company A shareholders: Combined value - A standalone - Price paid = $7.7B - $5B - $2.4B = $300M. Company A captures $300M. Total value created: $400M (to B) + $300M (to A) = $700M ✓. (5) Why pay 12× when market is 10×?: Control premium: Acquirer pays premium (20% above market) for control. Premium = (12× - 10×) / 10× = 20%. Justified by synergies: Net synergies = $700M. Premium paid = $400M. Synergies ($700M) > Premium ($400M) → creates value ($300M for A). Company A can "afford" to pay premium because synergies exceed it. Strategic value: Company B may have unique assets (technology, customers, talent). Not available elsewhere. Competitive bidding: Other bidders may drive price up. Winner\'s curse risk: Overpay in auction. Market multiple (10×) reflects standalone value. Acquisition multiple (12×) reflects: Standalone value (10×) + Strategic value/synergies (2×). Key insight: Premium paid (12× vs 10×, or $400M) < Net synergies ($700M). Deal creates value for both parties. If premium > synergies: Company A overpays, destroys value. Example: If paid 14× ($2.8B): Premium = $800M. Net synergies = $700M. Company A destroys $100M value (overpaid). Lesson: Can pay above market multiple IF synergies justify premium. Discipline: Premium ≤ Net synergies. Otherwise, walk away.',
