        question:
            'You are valuing a mature company with FCFF of $100M growing at 3% perpetually. WACC is 10%. A peer company just sold for 12× EBITDA. Your company EBITDA is $120M. Net debt is $200M, non-operating assets $50M, 100M shares outstanding. Calculate: (1) Enterprise value using DCF (perpetuity method), (2) Enterprise value using exit multiple, (3) Equity value per share under both methods, (4) Which method is more appropriate and why?, (5) What is the implied exit multiple in your DCF valuation?',
        sampleAnswer:
            'Complete valuation with method comparison: (1) DCF using perpetuity growth: Terminal value = FCFF / (WACC - g) = $100M / (0.10 - 0.03) = $100M / 0.07 = $1,428.6M. Since this is perpetuity starting year 0, Enterprise Value = $1,428.6M (no need to discount if FCFF is year 1). Actually, if $100M is year 1 FCFF, then Enterprise Value today = $1,428.6M already in PV terms. (2) Exit multiple method: Enterprise Value = EBITDA × Multiple = $120M × 12 = $1,440M. (3) Equity value per share: DCF method: Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt + Non-op Assets = $1,428.6M - $200M + $50M = $1,278.6M. Value per share = $1,278.6M / 100M = $12.79. Exit multiple method: Equity Value = $1,440M - $200M + $50M = $1,290M. Value per share = $1,290M / 100M = $12.90. (4) Most appropriate method: For mature, stable company, DCF perpetuity method more appropriate because: Reflects company-specific cash flow characteristics. Not dependent on potentially inflated M&A prices. Perpetual 3% growth aligns with GDP (reasonable for mature company). WACC of 10% seems reasonable for stable business. Exit multiple useful as reality check, but: M&A multiples include synergies (control premium). May reflect market euphoria or temporary conditions. Peer comparable may not be perfect match (different margins, growth). However, both methods yield similar value ($12.79 vs $12.90, <1% difference), which validates assumptions. Recommendation: Use DCF as primary method, exit multiple as secondary confirmation. Report range: $12.75-$13.00 per share. (5) Implied exit multiple in DCF: From DCF, Enterprise Value = $1,428.6M. Implied EBITDA multiple = EV / EBITDA = $1,428.6M / $120M = 11.9×. Very close to 12× peer multiple (within rounding). This convergence strengthens confidence in both valuations. Key insight: When DCF and comps align, valuation is robust. When they diverge significantly, dig deeper—one set of assumptions likely wrong.',

        question:
            'You project 5 years of FCFF: Year 1: $50M, Year 2: $60M, Year 3: $70M, Year 4: $78M, Year 5: $84M. WACC = 9%, terminal growth = 2.5%. Calculate: (1) PV of explicit forecast period, (2) Terminal value at end of year 5, (3) PV of terminal value, (4) Enterprise value, (5) If terminal value is >75% of enterprise value, what should you do and why?',
        sampleAnswer:
            'Complete DCF valuation with terminal value analysis: (1) PV of explicit forecast (Years 1-5): Year 1: $50M / (1.09)^1 = $45.87M. Year 2: $60M / (1.09)^2 = $50.51M. Year 3: $70M / (1.09)^3 = $54.06M. Year 4: $78M / (1.09)^4 = $55.26M. Year 5: $84M / (1.09)^5 = $54.60M. Total PV (Years 1-5) = $45.87 + $50.51 + $54.06 + $55.26 + $54.60 = $260.30M. (2) Terminal value at end of Year 5: FCFF in Year 6 = Year 5 × (1 + g) = $84M × 1.025 = $86.1M. Terminal Value = FCFF_6 / (WACC - g) = $86.1M / (0.09 - 0.025) = $86.1M / 0.065 = $1,324.6M. This is the value at the END of Year 5 (in Year 5 dollars). (3) PV of terminal value: Discount back 5 years: PV(TV) = $1,324.6M / (1.09)^5 = $1,324.6M / 1.5386 = $860.96M. (4) Enterprise value: EV = PV of explicit period + PV of terminal value = $260.30M + $860.96M = $1,121.26M. (5) Terminal value percentage: TV % = PV(TV) / EV = $860.96M / $1,121.26M = 76.8%. Terminal value represents 76.8% of enterprise value (>75% threshold). Concerns and actions: Problem: Model outcome driven by single perpetuity assumption. Small changes to terminal growth or WACC create huge valuation swings. Example: If terminal growth = 2% instead of 2.5%: TV = $86.1M × (1.02/1.025) / (0.09 - 0.02) = $85.69M / 0.07 = $1,224.1M. PV(TV) = $1,224.1M / 1.5386 = $795.6M. New EV = $260.30M + $795.6M = $1,055.9M. Value drops 5.8% from tiny 0.5% change in terminal growth! Recommended actions: (a) Extend explicit forecast period: Project 7-10 years instead of 5 years. Goal: Get to 60-70% TV, not 76.8%. Model until company reaches "steady state" maturity. (b) Use exit multiple as reality check: Calculate implied EBITDA multiple from terminal value. Compare to industry trading/transaction multiples. If implied multiple is 15× but industry trades at 10×, assumptions too aggressive. (c) Perform comprehensive sensitivity analysis: Create 2-way sensitivity table (WACC × terminal growth). Show full range of outcomes. Test extreme scenarios (recession, boom). (d) Triangulate with other methods: Comparable companies analysis. Precedent transactions. Asset-based valuation (if appropriate). (e) Consider probability-weighted scenarios: Base case (50% probability). Bull case (25%). Bear case (25%). Expected value = weighted average. Bottom line: When TV >75%, valuation is speculation, not analysis. Extend forecast period or use alternative methods for primary valuation.',

        question:
            'Three companies in same industry: Company A: P/E = 25, PEG = 1.0, EV/EBITDA = 15, Revenue growth = 25%. Company B: P/E = 15, PEG = 1.5, EV/EBITDA = 10, Revenue growth = 10%. Company C: P/E = 10, PEG = 2.0, EV/EBITDA = 6, Revenue growth = 5%. Using relative valuation: (1) Which company appears most expensive and why?, (2) Which company appears best value and why?, (3) What additional information would you need to make informed decision?, (4) Calculate implied P/E for a company with 20% growth using PEG = 1.25 (peer average), (5) Explain limitations of using P/E multiples for comparison.',
        sampleAnswer:
            'Comprehensive relative valuation analysis: (1) Most expensive (relative to growth): Company A appears expensive on absolute basis (P/E = 25, EV/EBITDA = 15 highest). But has highest growth (25%), so PEG = 1.0 is actually fair! Company B: PEG = 1.5 (expensive relative to growth). P/E = 15, but only 10% growth. Paying 1.5× for each unit of growth. Company C: PEG = 2.0 (most expensive relative to growth!). P/E = 10 seems cheap, but only 5% growth. Paying 2× for each unit of growth. Conclusion: Company C is most expensive on growth-adjusted basis despite low P/E. Company B is moderately expensive. Company A fairly valued (PEG = 1.0). PEG ratio reveals what P/E alone obscures! (2) Best value: Company A appears best value because: PEG = 1.0 (fair value rule of thumb: PEG ≈ 1.0). High growth (25%) justifies high P/E (25). EV/EBITDA = 15 is high, but if EBITDA growing 25%/year, will grow into multiple quickly. If quality/margins similar to peers, Company A offers best risk/reward. However, must verify: Is 25% growth sustainable? Are profit margins comparable? What is competitive position? Company B and C trade at premiums (PEG > 1.0) despite lower growth, suggesting: Market expects growth acceleration, or Perceived quality/moat premium, or Temporarily depressed earnings (cyclical). (3) Additional information needed: Profitability metrics: EBITDA margins (maybe C has highest margins, justifying premium). ROE, ROIC (capital efficiency). Free cash flow conversion. Balance sheet quality: Net debt/EBITDA. Interest coverage. Liquidity position. Business quality: Competitive moat (brand, network effects). Market share trends. Customer retention/churn. Management quality. Growth sustainability: Addressable market size. Competitive intensity. Product pipeline. Historical vs. forward multiples: Current metrics vs. NTM (next 12 months). Analyst consensus estimates. Risk factors: Business model stability. Regulatory exposure. Cyclicality. (4) Implied P/E for 20% growth company: Given PEG = 1.25 (average of A: 1.0, B: 1.5, C: 2.0). PEG = P/E / Growth. P/E = PEG × Growth = 1.25 × 20 = 25. Implied P/E = 25 for company with 20% growth. Interpretation: Market prices growth at 1.25× multiplier. $25 per dollar of earnings for 20% grower. (5) Limitations of P/E multiples: (a) Ignores capital structure: Company with high debt may have low P/E (high risk). EV/EBITDA better for comparing companies with different leverage. (b) Earnings can be manipulated: Accounting choices (depreciation, amortization). One-time items distort ratios. Use normalized earnings or cash flow metrics. (c) Negative earnings: P/E undefined if earnings negative. Can\'t compare loss-making companies. Use EV/Revenue for unprofitable high-growth firms. (d) Growth not captured: P/E alone doesn\'t adjust for growth. PEG ratio addresses this, but still imperfect. (e) Cyclical distortion: P/E appears low at peak earnings (worst time to buy). P/E appears high at trough earnings (best time to buy). Adjust for cycle (use normalized earnings). (f) Quality differences: Two companies with P/E = 20 may have very different: Competitive positions. Return on capital. Management quality. Growth durability. Need qualitative analysis alongside multiples. Bottom line: Multiples are starting point, not ending point. Always combine quantitative multiples with qualitative business analysis. Company C (PEG = 2.0) is not "worst value" if it has superior quality, moat, and returns on capital.',
