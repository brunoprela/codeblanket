    question:
      'Explain Operational Transformation (OT) vs CRDTs for real-time collaborative editing. When would you choose each? How do they handle concurrent edits, network partitions, and conflict resolution? Design a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both for an AI code editor with real-time collaboration.',
    sampleAnswer:
      "OT: Transform operations relative to each other. Example: User A inserts \"x\" at position 5, User B deletes character at position 3. OT transforms A's insert to position 4 (adjusted for B's delete). Pros: Smaller operations, efficient. Cons: Complex transformation functions, central server required, doesn't handle network partitions well. CRDTs: Each operation is commutative (order doesn't matter). Example: Yjs uses list CRDT where each character has unique ID. Pros: Eventually consistent, works offline, no central authority, simpler. Cons: Larger data structures (metadata overhead), harder to implement custom behaviors. Choose OT when: Need central authority, online-only, small documents. Choose CRDT when: Offline support needed, p2p, large-scale. Hybrid for AI editor: Use Yjs (CRDT) for document structure + OT for AI suggestions. CRDT ensures users' edits merge correctly. When AI generates suggestion, treat as special operation with timestamp. If conflict (user edited same line), user edit wins. AI re-generates with new context. Network partition: CRDT allows offline work, syncs when online. AI features disabled offline (switch to local model). Presence: Separate WebSocket channel (doesn't need CRDT, ephemeral).",

    question:
      "Design a real-time presence system for an AI code editor showing: cursors, selections, who's viewing which file, typing indicators, and AI activity (when AI is generating). How do you handle: 100+ concurrent users in same project, network efficiency, and privacy (not everyone should see everyone)? What happens when user goes offline?",
    sampleAnswer:
      'Architecture: (1) WebSocket server (Socket.io or custom) per region. (2) Redis pub/sub for cross-server presence sync. (3) Presence data: {userId, fileId, cursor: {line, col}, selection, isTyping, lastSeen}. (4) AI activity: {fileId, generating: true, type: "completion/refactor"}. Scalability (100+ users): (1) Only broadcast presence for users in same file (not entire project). (2) Throttle cursor updates (send max every 50ms). (3) Aggregate: Send bulk updates every 100ms instead of individual. (4) Compression: Use binary protocol (Protocol Buffers) not JSON. Privacy: (1) File-level permissions: Only see presence of users in files you have access to. (2) "Stealth mode": User can disable presence broadcast. (3) Anonymous presence: Show "5 others viewing" without names. Network efficiency: (1) WebSocket for real-time, fallback to SSE. (2) Differential updates: Only send changes (cursor moved), not full state. (3) Cleanup: Remove stale presence after 30s of no heartbeat. Offline: (1) Client detects offline, stops broadcasting. (2) Server removes presence after heartbeat timeout. (3) On reconnect, re-broadcast current state. Database: Store last-active timestamp in PostgreSQL for persistent "who viewed this file" analytics.',

    question:
      'Your real-time collaborative editor has an AI assistant that makes suggestions. How do you handle: (1) AI suggestion appearing while multiple users are typing, (2) One user accepts, others need to see the change, (3) Undo/redo with AI changes, (4) Attribution (who made the change: user or AI)? How does this integrate with your CRDT/OT system?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'AI suggestions as special operations: (1) Generation: AI generates suggestion, assigned unique ID, stored as "pending" operation. Broadcasted to all users in file with metadata: {type: "ai_suggestion", id, text, position, requestedBy: userId}. (2) Preview: Each client shows ghost text (like GitHub Copilot). Doesn\'t affect CRDT until accepted. (3) Acceptance: User accepts â†’ transforms to normal insert operation, broadcasted as CRDT change. Other users see change appear. (4) Rejection: Delete pending suggestion. Concurrent edits: If user types while AI generating, AI watches CRDT stream, adjusts suggestion position. If edit conflicts with suggestion location, cancel suggestion. Multiple users accepting: First acceptance wins, transforms to CRDT insert. Other clients\' pending suggestions become stale, marked invalid. Undo/redo: Track operation type in history. Undo AI change: Treat like normal delete, but annotate as "undo AI suggestion". Attribution: Store in operation metadata: {author: userId, isAI: true/false, aiModel: "claude-3-5-sonnet"}. Show in gutter: green indicator for AI changes, blue for users. History view: Filter by AI vs human changes. Version control: Git commits show AI attribution in message: "Co-authored-by: AI Assistant".',
