    question:
      'What is the framework for solving recursive problems in interviews?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'The 4-step framework: 1) **Define the subproblem** - what does the function solve for smaller input?, 2) **Find the base case** - simplest input that can be solved directly, 3) **Write the recursive case** - express solution in terms of subproblem(s), 4) **Analyze complexity** - time and space, consider memoization. Always start by clearly stating: "This function takes X and returns Y by recursing on...". Communicate your thinking process clearly.',

    question:
      'How do you handle the interviewer asking "can you do this without recursion?"',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Strategy: 1) **Acknowledge tradeoff**: "Yes, I can convert to iteration. Recursion uses O(n) stack space, iteration would be O(1).", 2) **Explain approach**: "I\'d use an explicit stack to simulate the call stack", 3) **Ask clarification**: "Would you like me to implement the iterative version, or is understanding the approach sufficient?", 4) **If implementing**: convert methodically, 5) **Highlight when recursion is better**: "For tree traversal, recursion is cleaner and stack depth is usually manageable."',
    keyPoints: [
      'Acknowledge pros/cons of each approach',
      'Explain iterative conversion strategy',
      'Ask what level of detail they want',

    question:
      'What should you discuss about complexity for recursive solutions?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Discuss: 1) **Time complexity**: Count recursive calls and work per call. Use recursion tree or recurrence relation. Mention if exponential without memoization, 2) **Space complexity**: Call stack depth + auxiliary space. Mention O(n) for call stack if depth is n, 3) **Optimization**: If exponential, propose memoization and analyze improved complexity, 4) **Comparison**: "Without memo: O(2^n), with memo: O(n)", 5) **Trade-off**: Acknowledge space cost of memoization. Show you can analyze recursion rigorously.',
