    question:
      'Describe the key considerations and best practices for implementing this technique in a production system. What are the main challenges and how would you address them?',
    hint: 'Think about scale, quality, cost, and user experience.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Production implementation requires careful planning across multiple dimensions: **Quality control** - Implement automated validation to ensure outputs meet standards. Use metrics specific to the technique (e.g., mask quality for inpainting, pose accuracy for generation). **Scalability** - Design for horizontal scaling with proper queue management. Cache results where applicable. Monitor resource usage and implement auto-scaling. **Cost management** - Track per-operation costs. Implement tiering (fast/cheap vs slow/quality). Use batching to amortize fixed costs. **User experience** - Provide real-time feedback on progress. Handle failures gracefully with retry logic. Set appropriate expectations on timing. **Error handling** - Implement comprehensive error handling with fallbacks. Log all operations for debugging. Alert on unusual failure rates. **Testing** - Extensive testing across diverse inputs. A/B testing for quality improvements. Monitor user satisfaction metrics. Production deployment requires balancing these factors based on your specific use case and constraints.',

    question:
      'How would you evaluate the quality and effectiveness of results from this technique? Design a comprehensive evaluation strategy including both automated metrics and human evaluation.',
    hint: 'Consider both objective and subjective quality measures.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Comprehensive evaluation strategy: **Automated metrics** - Implement objective measurements: technical quality (resolution, sharpness), accuracy (prompt/result alignment), consistency (across batches). Use tools like CLIP scores, FID, IS depending on technique. Set thresholds for automatic pass/fail. **Human evaluation** - Critical for perceptual quality. Design evaluation protocol: show evaluators pairs of results, ask specific questions (which is better quality? which matches prompt better?). Collect ratings on scale. Use inter-rater reliability to ensure consistency. **A/B testing** - For improvements, run A/B tests with real users. Measure engagement, satisfaction, conversion as applicable. Statistical significance testing before rolling out changes. **Edge case testing** - Identify and test problematic scenarios. Create dataset of challenging cases. Track improvement on these over time. **Continuous monitoring** - Production metrics dashboard. Track success rates, average quality scores, user feedback. Alert on degradation. **Feedback loop** - Collect user feedback (thumbs up/down, detailed reports). Analyze patterns in negative feedback. Feed insights back into prompt engineering or model selection. Comprehensive evaluation combines quantitative metrics, qualitative assessment, and user feedback to ensure high-quality results.',

    question:
      'Compare this technique with alternative approaches for achieving similar goals. What are the trade-offs and when would you choose this technique over alternatives?',
    hint: 'Think about the specific strengths and weaknesses relative to other options.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Comparative analysis: **This technique strengths** - Identify unique advantages: quality, control, speed, or cost. Quantify where possible (2x faster, 50% cheaper, 10% higher quality). **Alternative approaches** - List 2-3 main alternatives with their characteristics. Compare objectively across dimensions: quality, speed, cost, ease of use, flexibility. **Trade-off analysis** - Quality vs speed: Higher quality often means slower. Cost vs control: More control usually costs more. Simplicity vs capability: Easier tools may be less powerful. **Decision framework** - Create decision tree based on requirements: If need highest quality and have budget → Technique A. If need speed and have volume → Technique B. If need flexibility → Technique C. **Use case mapping** - Map common use cases to best technique. Consider multiple techniques in pipeline (different tools for different stages). **Production recommendation** - For most cases, suggest starting with balanced approach. Scale complexity as needs grow. Consider hybrid strategies using multiple techniques. Decision should be driven by specific requirements: what matters most for your application (quality/speed/cost/control), available resources (budget/expertise/infrastructure), and scale (volume/variety). Test alternatives empirically with your actual use cases before committing.',
