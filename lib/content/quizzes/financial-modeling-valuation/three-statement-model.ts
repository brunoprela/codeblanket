    question:
      'You are building a three-statement model for a manufacturing company. The CFO tells you: "We target 45 days for receivables, but it\'s actually been creeping up to 55 days. We\'re working to bring it back down over the next 3 years." You also discover that inventory turns have been declining from 8x to 6x annually due to product mix changes. Design how you would model: (a) The working capital dynamics with improving receivables but worsening inventory, (b) The cash flow impact of these changes, (c) Sensitivity analysis showing the cash impact if receivables improvement fails to materialize, (d) Warning flags if working capital becomes unsustainable. Provide specific formulas and Python pseudocode.',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Working capital modeling with dynamic drivers: (a) **Modeling approach**: Separate schedule for each WC component with different driver trajectories. Accounts Receivable: Year 0 (base): 55 days. Year 1: 52 days (improving). Year 2: 48 days. Year 3: 45 days (target achieved). Year 4-5: 45 days (stable). Formula: AR = Revenue × (Days_AR / 365). Inventory: Convert turns to days: Days_Inventory = 365 / Inventory_Turns. Year 0: 365/6 = 61 days. Year 1: 365/5.5 = 66 days (worsening). Year 2: 365/5 = 73 days. Year 3+: 73 days (stable at new product mix). Formula: Inventory = COGS × (Days_Inventory / 365). Accounts Payable: Assume stable at 35 days. AP = COGS × (Days_AP / 365). Net Working Capital = AR + Inventory - AP. (b) **Cash flow impact**: In Cash Flow Statement, Operating Cash Flow section: Change in NWC = (NWC_year_t - NWC_year_{t-1}). Increase in NWC is cash outflow (negative). Decrease in NWC is cash inflow (positive). Example Year 1: Revenue grows 10% to $110M. AR improves from 55 to 52 days: AR_year_0 = $100M × (55/365) = $15.07M. AR_year_1 = $110M × (52/365) = $15.67M. ∆AR = +$0.60M (small increase despite improvement because revenue grew). Inventory worsens from 61 to 66 days: Assuming COGS = 60% of revenue: Inventory_year_0 = $60M × (61/365) = $10.03M. Inventory_year_1 = $66M × (66/365) = $11.94M. ∆Inventory = +$1.91M (cash outflow). Total ∆NWC ≈ $2.5M (uses cash). Impact: Even with AR improvement, the inventory deterioration and revenue growth consume cash. This is realistic: fast-growing companies often have NWC headwind. (c) **Sensitivity analysis**: Base case: AR improves to 45 days by Year 3. Downside case: AR stalls at 52 days (improvement fails). Calculate cash impact: By Year 3, Revenue = $133M. Base case AR: $133M × (45/365) = $16.4M. Downside AR: $133M × (52/365) = $18.9M. Difference = $2.5M more cash trapped in receivables. Cumulative impact Years 1-3: ~$5-7M additional cash consumed. Implementation: Create scenario toggle in assumptions: AR_Improvement_Success = TRUE/FALSE. If FALSE, use  higher days assumptions. Run data table varying this toggle to show cash impact. (d) **Warning flags**: Implement checks: (1) Days receivable > 60 days: \"⚠ Collections risk - AR aging badly\". (2) Inventory turns < 4x: \"⚠ Inventory obsolescence risk\". (3) Net WC / Revenue > 25%: \"⚠ Excessive working capital - cash drag\". (4) ∆NWC > 30% of Operating CF for 2+ years: \"⚠ Working capital consuming too much cash\". (5) Cash balance < Min(3 months OpEx, Debt covenants): \"⚠ Liquidity risk\". Python pseudocode: ```class WorkingCapitalModel: def __init__(self, assumptions): self.ar_trajectory = assumptions['ar_days'] # [55, 52, 48, 45, 45] self.inv_turns = assumptions['inv_turns'] # [6, 5.5, 5, 5, 5] self.ap_days = assumptions['ap_days'] # 35 (constant) def calculate_nwc(self, year, revenue, cogs): ar = revenue * (self.ar_trajectory[year] / 365). inv_days = 365 / self.inv_turns[year]. inv = cogs * (inv_days / 365). ap = cogs * (self.ap_days / 365). nwc = ar + inv - ap. return {'AR': ar, 'Inventory': inv, 'AP': ap, 'NWC': nwc} def cash_impact(self, year, nwc_current, nwc_prior): return -(nwc_current['NWC'] - nwc_prior['NWC']) # Negative of increase def validate_wc(self, year, nwc, revenue, operating_cf): warnings = []. if nwc['AR'] / revenue * 365 > 60: warnings.append(\"Collections risk\"). if 365 / (nwc['Inventory'] / cogs) < 4: warnings.append(\"Inventory obsolescence\"). if nwc['NWC'] / revenue > 0.25: warnings.append(\"Excessive WC\"). return warnings```. Key insight: Working capital is often overlooked but can be massive cash drain for growing companies. Model it realistically (not all metrics improve simultaneously). AR might improve but inventory could worsen due to business reality. Sensitivity to WC assumptions is critical - $5-10M swings in cash consumption are common from small changes in days assumptions.",

    question:
      "You inherit a three-statement model from a departing analyst. When you check it, you find: (1) Balance sheet Assets = $500M, Liabilities + Equity = $485M (doesn't balance), (2) Cash Flow ending cash = $75M, but Balance Sheet cash = $68M (doesn't tie), (3) Net income flows to retained earnings correctly, (4) D&A is in the income statement but not added back in cash flow statement. You need to present this model to the board tomorrow. Diagnose: (a) What is likely causing each error?, (b) Which error is most critical and must be fixed first?, (c) Step-by-step fix for each issue, (d) How to quickly validate the fixes worked, (e) Preventive checks to add so this never happens again.",
    sampleAnswer:
      'Systematic model debugging and remediation: (a) **Diagnosis of errors**: Error 1 - Balance Sheet doesn\'t balance ($15M gap): Likely causes: (1) Retained earnings formula missing net income link: RE should = RE_prior + Net Income - Dividends. Check if "=RE_prior + Net Income" is actually "=RE_prior" (forgot to add income). (2) Cash is hard-coded instead of being a plug/calculated value. (3) Debt schedule not flowing to balance sheet properly. (4) One-time adjustment (acquisition, asset write-down) not reflected properly. Error 2 - Cash doesn\'t tie ($7M gap): Likely causes: (1) Cash Flow beginning cash ≠ prior period Balance Sheet ending cash. (2) Balance Sheet cash is hard-coded as a number, not formula "=CashFlow_EndingCash". (3) Cash Flow has error in calculations (operating/investing/financing don\'t sum correctly). (4) Hidden circular reference causing iterative calc to not converge. Error 3 - D&A missing from cash flow: This is MAJOR ERROR. D&A reduces net income (income statement) but doesn\'t use cash. MUST add back in Operating Cash Flow. Impact: Operating cash flow understated by D&A amount (could be $20-50M annually). Free Cash Flow massively understated, leading to severe undervaluation. (b) **Criticality ranking** (fix in this order): Priority 1: D&A missing from cash flow (most material impact on valuation). Priority 2: Balance sheet doesn\'t balance (model is fundamentally broken if Assets ≠ L+E). Priority 3: Cash doesn\'t tie (important for accuracy but less critical than above). (c) **Step-by-step fixes**: Fix 1 - Add D&A to cash flow: In Cash Flow Statement, Operating Activities section: Net Income: [link]. +D&A: =[Income Statement D&A cell] × -1 (make positive, since it was negative expense). Or if D&A is already positive: +D&A: =[Income Statement D&A cell]. Test: Operating CF should increase by D&A amount (e.g., if D&A = $30M, OCF goes up $30M). Fix 2 - Balance sheet balancing: Step 1: Verify equation manually: Assets = $500M. Liabilities + Equity = $485M. Missing: $15M. Step 2: Trace likely culprits: Check Retained Earnings: Should = Opening RE + Net Income - Dividends. If formula is "=Opening_RE", FIX to "=Opening_RE + Net_Income - Dividends". This will add cumulative net income (~$15M missing). Step 3: If RE is correct, check if any asset/liability accounts are hard-coded. Look for cells with numbers (no "=" sign). Replace with formulas. Step 4: If still doesn\'t balance, make Cash a plug: Cash = Total_Assets - (Total_Non_Cash_Assets) where Total_Assets = Liabilities + Equity. This forces balance. Fix 3 - Cash tie: Step 1: In Balance Sheet, Cash cell: Change from hard-coded number to "=[CashFlow Sheet, Ending Cash cell]". Step 2: Verify Cash Flow ending cash formula: = Beginning_Cash + Operating_CF + Investing_CF + Financing_CF. Step 3: Verify beginning cash: Year 1 beginning = Balance Sheet Year 0 ending. Year 2+ beginning = Prior year Cash Flow ending. Step 4: If circular reference error appears (cash affects interest, interest affects cash), enable iterative calculation: Excel: File → Options → Formulas → Enable iterative calculation. Or restructure to make cash a plug. (d) **Validation checks** (add these formulas): Check 1 - Balance sheet: Cell: "Balance Check" Formula: =IF(ABS(Total_Assets - (Total_Liabilities + Total_Equity)) < 1, "✓ BALANCES", "❌ DOES NOT BALANCE"). Conditional formatting: Green if balanced, RED if not. Check 2 - Cash tie: Cell: "Cash Tie Check". Formula: =IF(ABS(CashFlow_EndingCash - BalanceSheet_Cash) < 1, "✓ TIES", "❌ DOESN\'T TIE"). Check 3 - D&A in cash flow: Cell: "D&A Check". Formula: =IF(CashFlow_DA_Amount <> 0, "✓ Present", "⚠ Missing"). Check 4 - Retained earnings flow: Cell: "Net Income Flow Check". Formula: =IF(BalanceSheet_RE = OpeningRE + NetIncome - Dividends, "✓ Flows", "❌ Doesn\'t flow"). Put all checks in prominent "Model Checks" section at top, with conditional formatting. (e) **Preventive measures**: (1) Model checklist: Before any model goes to stakeholders, verify: ☐ Balance sheet balances (Assets = L + E). ☐ Cash flow ties to balance sheet. ☐ Net income flows to retained earnings. ☐ D&A is added back in cash flow. ☐ All three statements link properly. ☐ No hard-coded formulas (except inputs). ☐ Circular references handled properly. (2) Automated validation tab: Create "Checks" worksheet with formulas for each validation. Dashboard with red/green indicators. Model cannot be finalized until all checks are green. (3) Color coding: Blue = inputs (user changes). Black = formulas (calculated). Red = hard-coded numbers in formulas (SHOULD NOT EXIST except inputs). Audit model monthly to find red items. (4) Version control: Save versions: Model_v1.0_DateInitial.xlsx, Model_v1.1_DateFixedCash.xlsx. Track changes in changelog tab. (5) Peer review: Another analyst must review model before board presentation. Reviewer checks: Model ties, Assumptions reasonable, Formulas correct, No hard-coded numbers. (6) Training: Team training on: Three-statement model fundamentals, Common errors and how to avoid, Validation checks, Best practices. (7) Templates: Start all models from validated template with built-in checks. Don\'t build from scratch each time. Key insight: Most model errors are avoidable with structure and process. 80% of bugs come from: forgotten links, hard-coded numbers, missing add-backs. Automated checks catch these instantly.',

    question:
      'Your CEO asks: "Build me a model that shows what happens if we grow revenue 30% next year through aggressive pricing (cutting prices 15%) and higher marketing spend (+$20M). But I\'m worried about working capital—will we have enough cash?" Build a three-statement model scenario addressing: (a) How to model 30% revenue growth driven by price cuts and volume increases, (b) Working capital implications of fast growth, (c) Debt capacity and covenant analysis (Net Debt/EBITDA must stay < 3.0x), (d) Cash runway calculation, (e) Recommendation with specific metrics and risks.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Comprehensive scenario analysis with working capital and covenant constraints: (a) **Revenue model**: Decompose 30% growth into price and volume effects: Base revenue = $200M. Price change = -15%. Volume growth needed = (1.30 / 0.85) - 1 = 52.9% (!). Formula: New Revenue = Base × (1 + Price Change) × (1 + Volume Change) = $200M × 0.85 × 1.529 = $260M ✓. Verify: $260M / $200M = 1.30 = 30% growth. Operating implications: Volume up 53% means: Production capacity must support 53% more units. COGS/unit same, but $20M extra marketing hits OpEx. COGS = Base COGS × Volume Factor = $120M × 1.529 = $183.5M (60% of revenue). COGS % of revenue = $183.5M / $260M = 70.6% (vs historical 60%). Gross margin compressed from 40% to 29.4% due to pricing. OpEx = Base OpEx + Extra Marketing = $50M + $20M = $70M (26.9% of revenue vs 25%). EBITDA = Revenue - COGS - OpEx = $260M - $183.5M - $70M = $6.5M (2.5% margin vs historical ~10%). EBITDA compression is severe - from ~$20M to $6.5M despite 30% revenue growth! (b) **Working capital implications**: Revenue growth → WC growth (linear relationship if days constant). Assume: Days AR = 45, Days Inventory = 60, Days AP = 30. Base NWC = AR + Inventory - AP: AR = $200M × (45/365) = $24.7M. Inventory = $120M × (60/365) = $19.7M. AP = $120M × (30/365) = $9.9M. Base NWC = $24.7M + $19.7M - $9.9M = $34.5M. New NWC (after growth): AR = $260M × (45/365) = $32.1M. Inventory = $183.5M × (60/365) = $30.2M (more COGS → more inventory). AP = $183.5M × (30/365) = $15.1M. New NWC = $32.1M + $30.2M - $15.1M = $47.2M. ∆NWC = $47.2M - $34.5M = $12.7M cash outflow. Cash impact: Operating CF = EBITDA - ∆NWC - Taxes - Interest. Even if EBITDA = $6.5M, minus $12.7M NWC investment = negative $6.2M before taxes/interest. Fast growth is consuming cash! (c) **Debt capacity and covenant**: Covenant: Net Debt / EBITDA < 3.0x. Starting: Debt = $50M, Cash = $30M, Net Debt = $20M, EBITDA = $20M, Ratio = 1.0x (safe). After growth scenario: EBITDA = $6.5M (compressed), Cash = $30M - $12.7M NWC - other uses = ~$10M (est), Debt = $50M + New Borrowing. If no new borrowing: Net Debt = $50M - $10M = $40M, Ratio = $40M / $6.5M = 6.2x. COVENANT BREACH! Need to reduce net debt or improve EBITDA. Options: (1) Don\'t do full $20M marketing (scale back to $10M) → EBITDA = $16.5M → ratio = 2.4x (OK). (2) Raise equity (dilutive). (3) Delay growth (stage over 2 years). (d) **Cash runway**: Calculate cash burn: Starting cash = $30M. Cash outflows Year 1: Working capital investment = $12.7M. CapEx (assume 3% of revenue) = $7.8M. Marketing = $20M. Interest (assume 6% on $50M debt) = $3M. Total cash out = $43.5M. Cash inflows Year 1: EBITDA = $6.5M. Less tax (assume 21% on EBT, roughly ~$1M) = $5.5M. Total cash in = $5.5M. Net cash burn = $43.5M - $5.5M = $38M. Ending cash = $30M - $38M = -$8M (CASH OUT!). Cash runway = $30M / ($38M/12) = ~9.5 months before running out. (e) **Recommendation**: "CEO, the aggressive growth scenario creates severe challenges: (1) EBITDA compression: Margins fall from 10% to 2.5% due to pricing strategy. (2) Cash burn: $38M cash outflow in Year 1. We run out of cash in 9-10 months. (3) Covenant breach: Net Debt/EBITDA jumps to 6.2x (covenant is <3.0x). Bank will likely freeze credit or demand repayment. (4) Working capital: $12.7M additional cash trapped in AR/inventory to support growth. Recommendations: Option A (Moderate): Reduce marketing to $10M, target 20% revenue growth, maintain pricing discipline. Result: EBITDA ~$16M, cash burn ~$15M, ratio ~2.5x (OK). Option B (Staged): Year 1: 15% growth, $10M marketing. Year 2: Accelerate if successful. Option C (Financing): If committed to 30% growth, need to raise $40M equity or $50M debt refinancing with looser covenants. Risk assessment: Pricing cuts are dangerous - hard to reverse. Customers expect low prices permanently. If volume assumptions miss (assume 53% volume growth), cash crisis worsens. Market share gains may not be sustainable. Recommended: Option A (moderate growth) or Option B (staged). Full 30% scenario is financially unsustainable without significant capital raise."
