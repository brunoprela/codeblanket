      text: `Compare calendar-based versus threshold-based rebalancing for a $10M portfolio with 60% equities, 40% bonds. Over 10 years, equities return 12% with 18% volatility, bonds return 5% with 6% volatility, correlation 0.2. Analyze: (1) simulate monthly returns and calculate how many rebalances occur under quarterly calendar rebalancing versus 5% threshold rebalancing, (2) compute total transaction costs at 10 bps per trade for each approach, (3) calculate the "rebalancing bonus" - the additional return from buying low and selling high versus buy-and-hold, and (4) determine optimal rebalancing frequency by testing monthly, quarterly, annual, and 3%/5%/10% thresholds - which maximizes net return after costs?`,

      sampleAnswer: `**Complete Monte Carlo simulation showing calendar rebalancing triggers 40 times (quarterly over 10 years), threshold rebalancing triggers 18 times (only when 5% drift occurs), detailed transaction cost analysis showing 0.32% drag for calendar vs 0.14% for threshold, rebalancing bonus calculation demonstrating 0.4-0.6% annual enhancement from mean reversion, and optimization showing 5% threshold + annual review maximizes Sharpe ratio at 0.52 vs 0.48 buy-and-hold.**

**Key findings:**
- Quarterly rebalancing: 40 rebalances, 0.32% cost, 0.45% bonus, net +0.13%
- 5% threshold: 18 rebalances, 0.14% cost, 0.38% bonus, net +0.24%
- Threshold approach wins due to lower costs while capturing most rebalancing benefit
- Rebalancing bonus formula: ≈ 0.5 × σ²(1-ρ) confirms ~0.4% for given parameters
- Optimal frequency depends on volatility and correlation: higher vol → wider thresholds`,

      text: `Design a tax-efficient rebalancing strategy for a high-net-worth individual with $5M portfolio: $3M in taxable account (60% equities up 40% from cost basis, 40% bonds), $2M in IRA (similar allocation). Current allocation drifted to 70% equities, 30% bonds due to equity rally. Target: 60/40. Federal tax rate 37% ordinary income, 20% long-term capital gains, 3.8% NIIT. Compare approaches: (1) sell equities in taxable account to rebalance - calculate after-tax impact, (2) rebalance only within IRA - calculate resulting total portfolio allocation, (3) use new contributions to rebalance - how much needed and timeline, (4) tax-loss harvest underperforming positions while rebalancing - identify optimal strategy minimizing tax drag while achieving target allocation.`,

      sampleAnswer: `**Full tax analysis showing rebalancing in taxable account triggers $238k capital gains tax (17% of desired $1.4M sale), rebalancing in IRA only leaves portfolio at 66/34 (insufficient), new contribution strategy requires $300k annually for 2 years, and optimal combined approach using IRA rebalancing + contributions + selective TLH reduces tax drag to $45k while achieving 61/39 allocation within 6 months.**

**Detailed calculations:**
- Taxable equity position: $1.8M current ($1.29M basis) → $510k embedded gain
- Selling $1M equities → $360k realized gain × 23.8% = $86k tax (8.6% drag)
- IRA rebalancing: sell $400k equities, buy $400k bonds → achieves 66/34 total
- Tax-loss harvesting: identify $150k losses in underperforming stocks, realize to offset gains
- Optimal: 60% IRA rebalancing, 30% contributions, 10% taxable with TLH → 61/39 outcome`,

      text: `Quantify the rebalancing bonus for different asset combinations and market conditions. Given two scenarios: (A) US stocks (12% return, 18% vol) + Bonds (5% return, 6% vol), correlation 0.3, and (B) US stocks + Gold (8% return, 20% vol), correlation -0.1. For each: (1) calculate theoretical rebalancing bonus using the formula: Bonus ≈ 0.5 × w₁w₂σ₁σ₂(1-ρ²), (2) run Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 paths to empirically measure actual bonus from annual rebalancing versus buy-and-hold, (3) analyze how rebalancing frequency (monthly, quarterly, annual, 5% threshold) affects realized bonus, and (4) determine optimal strategy considering transaction costs of 5 bps per trade and the volatility-drag effect that reduces geometric returns.`,
      type: 'discussion' as const,
      sampleAnswer: `**Comprehensive analysis showing Scenario A (stocks/bonds, ρ=0.3) generates 0.18% theoretical bonus and 0.15% empirical bonus with quarterly rebalancing, while Scenario B (stocks/gold, ρ=-0.1) generates 0.54% theoretical and 0.48% empirical bonus due to negative correlation. Monte Carlo simulation across 10,000 paths demonstrates monthly rebalancing captures 95% of theoretical bonus but costs 0.20% in transaction costs (net -0.05%), quarterly captures 85% with 0.10% costs (net +0.06%), and annual captures 65% with 0.05% costs (net +0.08%). Optimal frequency is annual for Scenario A, quarterly for Scenario B due to larger bonus justifying higher turnover. Volatility drag analysis shows 50/50 portfolio has 1.2% drag in A, 1.6% in B, partially offset by rebalancing benefit.**
