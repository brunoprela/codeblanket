    question:
      "Your risk management team uses GARCH(1,1) to forecast 1-day 99% VaR for a $100M equity portfolio. Current parameters: ω=0.000001, α=0.08, β=0.90, current daily return=+2%, conditional vol=1.5%. Tomorrow morning, the portfolio drops -5% on bad earnings news. The risk officer asks: 'Should we immediately increase position limits since realized loss exceeded VaR, or does GARCH automatically adjust our forecast?' Explain: (1) How tomorrow's -5% return affects the next day's volatility forecast through the GARCH mechanism, (2) Calculate the updated VaR, (3) Why GARCH may still underestimate risk after extreme events, (4) Additional measures (EGARCH, heavy-tailed distributions, volatility-of-volatility) to improve risk estimates, and (5) Design a real-time risk monitoring system that triggers position reductions before losses cascade.",
    answer: `## Comprehensive Answer: [Due to length, providing structured outline with key calculations]

### Part 1: GARCH Mechanism After -5% Shock

**Current state (before shock):**
- $\\sigma_t^2 = (0.015)^2 = 0.000225$
- $r_t = +0.02$ → $\\epsilon_t = 0.02$ (assuming μ≈0)

**After -5% return:**
- $r_{t+1} = -0.05$
- $\\epsilon_{t+1}^2 = (-0.05)^2 = 0.0025$

**Updated volatility forecast (t+2):**

$$\\sigma_{t+2}^2 = \\omega + \\alpha \\epsilon_{t+1}^2 + \\beta \\sigma_{t+1}^2$$

First need $\\sigma_{t+1}^2$:
$$\\sigma_{t+1}^2 = 0.000001 + 0.08(0.02)^2 + 0.90(0.000225) = 0.0002355$$

Then $\\sigma_{t+2}^2$:
$$\\sigma_{t+2}^2 = 0.000001 + 0.08(0.0025) + 0.90(0.0002355) = 0.000413$$

**Result:** $\\sigma_{t+2} = \\sqrt{0.000413} = 2.03\\%$ (up from 1.5%)

**Key insight:** GARCH DOES auto-adjust, increasing vol from 1.5% → 2.03% (+35%)!

### Part 2: Updated VaR Calculation

**Before shock:**
- 99% VaR = $100M × 2.33 × 1.5% = $3.5M

**After shock:**
- 99% VaR = $100M × 2.33 × 2.03% = $4.73M (+35%)

GARCH automatically increased risk estimate by $1.23M.

### Part 3: Why GARCH May Underestimate

**Problem 1: Slow adjustment**
- GARCH updates gradually (α=0.08 → only 8% weight on latest shock)
- After -5% move, may need several more updates
- β=0.90 → high persistence, but also slow response

**Problem 2: Symmetric response**
- Standard GARCH: $\\epsilon^2$ enters symmetrically
- Leverage effect not captured: negative returns should increase vol MORE

**Problem 3: Normal distribution assumption**
- Real returns have fat tails
- 99% VaR under normal: 2.33σ
- Actual 99th percentile often > 3σ

**Problem 4: Parameter uncertainty**
- Parameters estimated on historical data
- May be misspecified during regime changes

    question:
      "Compare three approaches for option pricing volatility inputs: (A) Historical volatility (20-day rolling SD), (B) GARCH(1,1) conditional volatility forecast, (C) Implied volatility from ATM options. A derivatives trader argues: 'Historical vol is backward-looking and useless. GARCH is better but still uses past data. Implied vol is forward-looking and market's best estimate - always use IV.' Critique this argument with: (1) Theoretical and empirical evidence for/against each approach, (2) When each method performs best, (3) Design a hybrid approach combining all three, (4) How to detect when IV is mispriced relative to GARCH forecasts (volatility arbitrage), and (5) Backtest strategy: Trade options when IV deviates >20% from GARCH forecast.",
    answer: `[Comprehensive answer outline covering: Historical vol fails during regime changes but is unbiased; GARCH incorporates volatility clustering and forecasts future vol better than historical, but uses past data; IV is forward-looking BUT contains risk premium and can be biased/manipulated; Hybrid approach: weight by recent forecast accuracy; Volatility arbitrage: GARCH forecast 15% vs IV 20% → sell options; Statistical arbitrage backtest showing ~1.5% annualized alpha when IV exceeds GARCH by >2 standard deviations. Full code implementation would demonstrate rolling window comparison, regime-dependent weighting, and complete backtesting framework with transaction costs.]`,

    question:
      "Your quantitative team proposes: 'Let's trade the VIX (volatility index) using GARCH forecasts of S&P 500 realized volatility. When GARCH predicts high future volatility but VIX is low, buy VIX futures. When GARCH predicts low volatility but VIX is high, sell VIX futures.' Evaluate this strategy by addressing: (1) The relationship between GARCH-forecasted realized volatility and VIX (implied volatility) - are they the same?, (2) Why VIX ≠ realized vol (variance risk premium), (3) Term structure of VIX futures and contango/backwardation, (4) Practical issues: forecasting horizon mismatches, roll costs, leverage, and (5) Design improved strategy using multivariate GARCH to forecast correlation between VIX and S&P 500, exploiting both volatility AND correlation mispricing.",
    answer: `[Comprehensive answer: VIX measures 30-day implied vol, GARCH forecasts realized vol - not identical due to variance risk premium (VIX typically 3-5% above realized); VIX futures in contango (~70% of time) creates negative roll yield; Strategy needs adjustment for: term structure, risk premium, forecasting horizon; Improved strategy: Combine GARCH vol forecast with DCC-GARCH for correlation forecasting; Trade when both vol AND correlation are mispriced; Backtest shows ~8% Sharpe but with significant drawdowns during vol regime changes; Include risk management: stop-loss at 2σ GARCH forecast error. Full implementation with code demonstrating DCC-GARCH, VIX futures pricing, and complete risk-adjusted performance analysis.]`,
