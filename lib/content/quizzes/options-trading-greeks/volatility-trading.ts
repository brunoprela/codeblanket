        question:
            'Design a "volatility risk premium (VRP) harvesting strategy" that systematically sells options to capture the premium. The system should: (1) Calculate historical VRP (IV minus RV) for your universe of stocks, (2) Select stocks where VRP is highest and most persistent, (3) Implement systematic option selling (short strangles or iron condors), (4) Size positions based on VRP magnitude and realized vol, (5) Implement stop-losses for tail risk events, (6) Backtest on 10+ years of data showing Sharpe ratio and max drawdown. Explain why VRP exists and how to exploit it sustainably.',
        sampleAnswer:
            'VRP Harvesting System: **VRP Calculation**: For each stock, calculate: IV = Current 30-day implied volatility from ATM options, RV = Realized volatility over past 30 days, VRP = IV - RV. Track this daily for 252+ trading days. Example SPY historical: Average VRP = 2.1% (IV typically 2.1% higher than RV), Standard deviation = 1.8%, Positive 68% of days. **Stock Selection**: Criteria: VRP > 1.5% (above median), VRP persistence: Positive in 60%+ of last 60 days, Liquid options: OI > 1000, bid-ask < $0.15, Stable fundamentals (avoid binary events). Top candidates: SPY, QQQ, IWM (indices), AAPL, MSFT, AMZN (mega caps). **Strategy Implementation**: For each selected stock: Sell 1 SD OTM strangle (16 delta puts/calls) or iron condor with wings at 2 SD, Expiration: 30-45 days, Target credit: 20-30% of wing width. Example SPY at $450, VRP = 2.5%: Sell 405 put + 495 call (1 SD), Buy 385 put + 515 call (wings), Credit: $2.25, max risk $17.75. **Position Sizing**: Allocate capital based on VRP magnitude: If VRP = 1.5-2.0%: Allocate 2% of capital, If VRP = 2.0-3.0%: Allocate 3% of capital, If VRP > 3.0%: Allocate 4% of capital (max), Inverse size by realized vol (higher RV = smaller size). Example: $1M portfolio, SPY VRP = 2.5%, RV = 15%, Allocation = 3% × (20% / 15%) = 4%, Position size: $40K risk, Iron condor: Max risk $1,775/contract, Contracts = $40K / $1,775 = 22 contracts. **Tail Risk Management**: Position-level stops: Exit at 50% of max loss (e.g., $1,775 max → exit at $888 loss), Or exit at 200% of credit (collected $225 → exit if costs $450 to close). Portfolio-level: Max 15% total portfolio at risk across all positions, VIX circuit breaker: Close all positions if VIX > 35 (crisis mode), Diversify: 10-15 positions across sectors. **Backtest Results (2010-2023, 14 years)**: Strategy: Sell iron condors on SPY, QQQ, IWM when VRP > 1.5%, Monthly trades: ~40 per year (120 total per year), Win rate: 72%, Avg profit per winner: $180, Avg loss per loser: -$420, Expected value per trade: 0.72×$180 - 0.28×$420 = $130 - $118 = $12/trade, Annual return: 120 trades × $12 = $1,440 per $10K deployed = 14.4%, Max drawdown: -22% (March 2020 COVID), Sharpe ratio: 1.2 (good risk-adjusted return), Calmar ratio: 14.4% / 22% = 0.65. **Why VRP Exists**: Insurance premium: Investors pay for downside protection (puts), Fear > greed: Markets price in catastrophic events, Supply/demand: More put buyers (hedgers) than sellers, Behavioral: Loss aversion makes people overpay for insurance. **Sustainable Exploitation**: Diversification: Multiple underlyings, uncorrelated sectors, Position sizing: Never risk > 5% per trade, Tail hedges: Buy cheap OTM puts (e.g., 3-month VIX calls) as insurance, Dynamic adjustment: Reduce exposure when VIX > 25, increase when VIX < 15, Continuous learning: Adapt to changing market regimes. **Risk Reality**: Despite positive EV, strategy has: Negative skew (small gains, rare large losses), Correlation to market crashes (all positions lose together in March 2020), Requires discipline (stick to stops, don\'t over-lever), NOT "free money" - requires active management. **Advanced Optimization**: VRP forecasting: Machine learning to predict when VRP highest, Regime detection: Identify high/low vol regimes, adjust accordingly, Cross-asset: Combine equities, currencies, commodities for diversification, Volatility targeting: Scale positions to maintain constant vol (e.g., 10% annual).',

        question:
            'Analyze "VIX futures term structure" and design trading strategies for both contango and backwardation regimes. For each regime: (1) Explain the structure and typical causes, (2) Calculate roll yield (cost of rolling futures), (3) Design long and short strategies, (4) Analyze VIX ETPs (VXX, UVXY, SVXY) behavior, (5) Provide entry/exit rules and position sizing, (6) Backtest showing performance in different market conditions. Include numerical examples with real VIX levels.',
        sampleAnswer:
            'VIX Term Structure Trading: **CONTANGO (Normal Market)**: Structure: Front month < back month (e.g., VIX spot 15, M1 16.5, M2 18, M3 19.5), Causes: Normal risk premium, calm markets, investors willing to pay for future protection, Roll yield: NEGATIVE for longs (must sell cheaper front, buy expensive back). Example: VIX spot = 15, M1 future = 16.5 (+10%), M2 = 18 (+20%). **Roll Yield Calculation**: Long M1 at 16.5, Hold 30 days → M1 becomes spot, converges to 15, Loss from convergence = 16.5 - 15 = 1.5 points / 16.5 = -9.1% monthly, Annualized roll cost = (1 - 0.909)^12 - 1 ≈ -70%+! This is why VXX decays to zero over time. **Contango Strategies**: SHORT STRATEGIES (Profit from decay): Trade: Short VIX futures (sell M1), Profit: As M1 converges to spot (16.5 → 15), collect 9.1%, Risk: VIX spikes (unlimited losses if naked), Management: Use spreads (sell M1, buy M2) to define risk. Alternative: SVXY (short VIX ETP), automatically captures roll yield, Caution: Can lose 80%+ in crashes (Feb 2018: SVXY lost 93% in 1 week!). **BACKWARDATION (Crisis)**: Structure: Front month > back month (e.g., VIX spot 45, M1 43, M2 38, M3 33), Causes: Immediate fear/panic, expectation vol will decline, Roll yield: POSITIVE for longs (sell expensive front, buy cheap back). Example: VIX spot = 45, M1 = 43 (-4.4%), M2 = 38 (-15.6%). **Roll Yield in Backwardation**: Long M1 at 43, VIX drops to 40 over 30 days (mean reversion), M1 converges to 40, Roll to M2: Sell M1 @ 40, buy M2 @ 36 (now front month), Net: Lost on VIX decline (43 → 40 = -7%) but gained on roll structure. **Backwardation Strategies**: LONG STRATEGIES: Trade: Long VIX futures (buy M1), Profit: Positive roll yield + potential VIX spike, Entry: Only when VIX > 30 AND backwardation, Exit: When flips to contango OR VIX < 20. Alternative: VXX/UVXY (long VIX ETPs), Benefit: Positive roll yield in backwardation, Still lose from theta decay if VIX flat. **VIX ETPs Behavior**: VXX (1× long): Contango: Decays ~5% monthly (-50% annually), Backwardation: Gains from roll yield + VIX moves, Since inception (2009): Down 99.9% (persistent contango). UVXY (1.5× leveraged long): Contango: Decays ~8% monthly (-65% annually), Backwardation: Amplified gains (1.5×), Even worse decay than VXX. SVXY (-0.5× short): Contango: Gains ~2.5% monthly (+35% annually), Backwardation: Loses rapidly, Feb 2018 crash: Lost 93% in 1 week when VIX spiked 115 → 37. **Entry/Exit Rules**: LONG VIX (Contango → Backwardation transition): Entry: VIX > 25 AND structure flips to backwardation, Or: VIX < 12 (buy fear cheap, before spike), Exit: VIX > 40 (sell fear), Or: Structure flips back to contango. SHORT VIX (Contango regime): Entry: VIX < 20 AND contango > 5% (M1-spot difference), Exit: VIX > 25 (stop loss), Or: Contango < 2% (roll yield too low). **Position Sizing**: VIX futures: 1 contract = $1000 × VIX, Margin: ~$5K per contract, Position size: Risk 5% of capital per contract, Example: $100K account, risk $5K, 1-2 contracts max. ETPs: More forgiving (no margin calls), Still size to 5-10% of portfolio max. **Backtest (2015-2023)**: LONG VIX Strategy (only in backwardation): Trades: 8 (rare backwardation events), Win rate: 75%, Avg profit: +45%, Avg loss: -15%, Annual return: 12% (on capital deployed during trades), Use: Tactical, event-driven only. SHORT VIX Strategy (contango regime): Trades: 85 (frequent), Win rate: 82%, Avg profit: +8%, Avg loss: -35%, Annual return: 18%, Max drawdown: -55% (March 2020), Use: Systematic, but requires strict risk management. **Real-World Example (COVID Crash March 2020)**: Feb 19: VIX = 14 (contango), short VIX profitable, Feb 28: VIX = 23 (warning sign), Mar 16: VIX = 82 (extreme spike, backwardation), Short VIX positions: -300% losses (wipeout), Long VIX positions: +400% gains, Lesson: ALWAYS have stop losses on short vol!',

        question:
            'Design a "dispersion trading strategy" that trades the relationship between index volatility and component volatilities. The system should: (1) Calculate fair value relationship between SPX IV and weighted average of component IVs, (2) Identify mispricing opportunities (index rich/cheap vs components), (3) Construct trades (long/short SPX options, opposite on components), (4) Account for correlation changes and their impact, (5) Implement position-sizing and hedging, (6) Backtest showing profitability during high/low correlation regimes. Explain when dispersion trading is most profitable.',
        sampleAnswer:
            'Dispersion Trading System: **Fair Value Relationship**: Theory: Index variance ≈ Σ(weight_i² × component_variance_i) + 2ΣΣ(weight_i × weight_j × correlation_ij × vol_i × vol_j). Simplified: SPX_IV² ≈ Weighted_Avg(Component_IV²) × Average_Correlation. Example: 10 stocks, avg IV = 25%, equal weight (10% each), correlation = 0.60. Weighted avg component variance = 25² = 625. Expected SPX variance = 625 × 0.60 = 375. Expected SPX IV = √375 = 19.4%. **Mispricing Detection**: If actual SPX IV = 18% (< 19.4%): Index CHEAP vs components (or correlation too high), Trade: BUY index vol (long SPX straddles), SELL component vol (short individual stock straddles). If actual SPX IV = 21% (> 19.4%): Index RICH vs components (or correlation too low), Trade: SELL index vol (short SPX straddles), BUY component vol (long individual stock straddles). **Position Construction**: Example (Index rich scenario, SPX IV = 21% vs fair 19.4%): SHORT SPX: Sell 1 SPX 4500 straddle, Notional: $4500 × 100 = $450K, Vega: $200/1% IV move, Collect: $210 premium (21% IV). LONG Components (10 stocks): Buy AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA, JPM, JNJ, XOM straddles, Notional: $45K each × 10 = $450K total, Vega: $200/1% IV move total (match SPX), Cost: $250 premium (25% avg IV). Net cost: $250 - $210 = $40 debit. **Delta Hedging**: Dispersion trade should be: Delta-neutral (hedge all directional exposure), Gamma-neutral (or small gamma), Pure vega play (long component vol, short index vol). Continuously rehedge: If SPX moves, rehedge SPX side with futures, If individual stocks move, rehedge with stock or futures. **Correlation Impact**: The key driver: When correlation DROPS: Components move independently → component vol rises, Index moves less → index vol drops, Dispersion trade profits (long components win, short index wins). When correlation RISES: Components move together → acts like index, Index vol rises, component vol relatively stable, Dispersion trade loses. **Expected Profit Scenarios**: Scenario 1 - Correlation drops 0.60 → 0.40: Component IVs stay 25%, SPX IV drops 21% → 16% (closer to fair value), Profit: Short SPX: Sold at 21%, buy back at 16% → +$1,000, Long components: Bought at 25%, sell at 25% → $0, Net: +$1,000 (from index vol collapse). Scenario 2 - Correlation stable, IVs revert to fair: Component IVs drop 25% → 23%, SPX IV drops 21% → 19.4%, Profit: Short SPX: +$320, Long components: -$400, Net: -$80 (small loss, theta/convergence). **Position Sizing**: Target: 1% of portfolio risk per trade, Vega exposure: Match index and component vegas, Notional: Keep index notional = sum of component notionals, Max concentration: No single stock > 15% of component leg. Example: $1M portfolio, 1% risk = $10K, SPX vega $200, components vega $200 (matched), Position: As calculated above. **Backtest (2015-2023)**: Total trades: 24 (enter when SPX IV misaligned by > 2% vs fair), Win rate: 62%, Avg profit: $1,850, Avg loss: -$1,200, Expected value: 0.62×$1,850 - 0.38×$1,200 = $1,147 - $456 = $691/trade, Annual return: ~15% on capital deployed, Best periods: Market transitions (crisis → calm), correlation drops rapidly. **When Most Profitable**: Crisis aftermath: Correlation drops as markets normalize (2020: 0.80 → 0.50 over 6 months), Sector rotation: Some sectors rally, others fall (low correlation), Earnings season: Individual company moves dominate (low correlation). **Risks**: Correlation rises: All stocks move together (2020 March: correlation → 0.90), Gamma risk: Large index moves require frequent rehedging, Execution: Slippage on 10+ individual stock options, Theta decay: Both legs lose time value if flat. **Advanced Implementation**: Dynamic hedging: Adjust component weights as correlations change, Machine learning: Predict correlation regime changes, Sector dispersion: Trade sector ETFs vs SPX (easier execution), Options vs variance swaps: Pure variance exposure (no gamma). **Real Example (2020)**: March: Correlation spikes to 0.85 (crisis), SPX IV = 40%, component avg = 50%, Fair value SPX IV = √(50² × 0.85) = 46%, Actual 40% < fair 46% → Index CHEAP. Trade: LONG SPX vol, SHORT components, Result over 6 months: Correlation dropped to 0.50, SPX IV rose to 30%, components dropped to 35%, Profit from mean reversion + correlation normalization.',
