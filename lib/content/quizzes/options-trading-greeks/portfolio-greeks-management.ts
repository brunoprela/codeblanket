      'Design a "portfolio Greeks risk management system" for a $5M options portfolio. The system should: (1) Calculate aggregate portfolio Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega) across 50+ positions, (2) Set risk limits for each Greek and implement alerts, (3) Create automated hedging rules when limits are breached, (4) Implement real-time P&L attribution to each Greek, (5) Generate daily risk reports with stress tests, (6) Backtest the system showing how it would have managed risk during March 2020 COVID crash. Provide specific limits and hedging strategies.',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Portfolio Greeks Risk Management System: **Portfolio Setup**: $5M options portfolio across: 20 underlyings (indices + individual stocks), 50+ total positions (mix of spreads, straddles, condors), Target: Delta-neutral with controlled gamma/vega. **Greek Aggregation Algorithm**: def calculate_portfolio_greeks(positions): totals = {'delta': 0, 'gamma': 0, 'theta': 0, 'vega': 0, 'rho': 0}; for pos in positions: multiplier = pos['contracts'] × 100; totals['delta'] += pos['delta'] × multiplier; totals['gamma'] += pos['gamma'] × multiplier; totals['theta'] += pos['theta'] × multiplier; totals['vega'] += pos['vega'] × multiplier; totals['rho'] += pos['rho'] × multiplier; return totals. **Risk Limits**: Based on $5M portfolio: Delta: ±10,000 shares ($4.5M at $450 SPY, 90% of portfolio), Rationale: Near market-neutral, small directional bias OK, Alert: Orange at ±8,000, red at ±10,000. Gamma: ±500, Rationale: Delta changes ±500 per $1 move (±$500K for $1K move), Alert: Orange at ±400, red at ±500. Theta: +$500 to +$5,000 per day, Rationale: Positive theta from premium selling ($150K-$1.8M annual), Alert: If negative theta > -$500 (losing to time decay). Vega: ±$50,000 per 1% IV, Rationale: Can handle ±$50K from 1% IV move (1% of portfolio), Alert: Orange at ±$40K, red at ±$50K. **Automated Hedging Rules**: DELTA BREACH: If |delta| > 10,000: Execute: Buy/sell SPY shares or futures to offset, Target: Reduce to ±5,000, Example: Delta = +12,000, sell 7,000 SPY shares. GAMMA BREACH: If |gamma| > 500: Execute: Close most gamma-intensive positions (short-dated ATM options), Or: Add opposite gamma (sell far OTM options), Target: Reduce to ±300. VEGA BREACH: If |vega| > $50,000: Execute: Close high-vega positions (long straddles), Or: Add opposite vega (short calendar spreads), Target: Reduce to ±$30,000. THETA IMBALANCE: If theta < -$500 (losing to decay): Execute: Close negative theta positions, Add positive theta (sell premium), Target: Theta > 0. **Real-Time P&L Attribution**: Track P&L contribution from each Greek: Delta P&L = Portfolio_Delta × Stock_Move, Gamma P&L = 0.5 × Portfolio_Gamma × (Stock_Move)², Theta P&L = Portfolio_Theta × Days_Passed, Vega P&L = Portfolio_Vega × IV_Change. Dashboard display: Today's P&L: +$12,500, Attribution: Delta: +$8,000 (SPY up $1.60), Gamma: +$2,000 (benefited from move), Theta: +$500 (time decay), Vega: +$2,000 (IV up 0.5%). **Daily Risk Report**: Morning report at 8am ET: Current portfolio Greeks vs limits, Positions by P&L (top winners/losers), Stress test results (scenarios: ±5%, ±10% SPY), Recommended actions (hedge delta, close position X). **Stress Testing**: Scenarios: Normal (+1%): Delta $50K, Vega -$2K, Total +$48K, Small down (-2%): Delta -$100K, Vega +$4K, Total -$96K, Large down (-5%): Delta -$250K, Vega +$10K, Total -$240K (4.8% portfolio), Crash (-10%): Delta -$500K, Vega +$25K, Total -$475K (9.5% portfolio), Extreme (-20%): Delta -$1M, Vega +$60K, Total -$940K (18.8% portfolio). Limits: Max acceptable loss: 15% of portfolio = $750K, Action: If crash scenario > $750K, reduce delta/gamma immediately. **March 2020 COVID Crash Backtest**: Pre-crash (Feb 19): Portfolio: $5M, Delta: +5,000, Gamma: 300, Vega: +$30K, Theta: +$800/day, SPY: $338. Week 1 (Feb 24-28, SPY 338→300, -11%): Delta P&L: +5,000 × (-38) = -$190K, Gamma P&L: +$217K (large move benefit), Vega P&L: +$30K × 15% IV spike = +$450K, Theta P&L: +$4K, Total: +$481K (up 9.6%!), Action: Hedge delta (sell 5K SPY @ $300 = $1.5M). Week 2 (Mar 2-6, SPY 300→290): With hedge, delta now 0, minimal directional P&L, Vega continues: +$200K, Theta: +$4K, Total: +$204K. Week 3 (Mar 9-13, SPY 290→250, -14%): Delta neutral, no directional loss, Vega: +$30K × 20% IV spike = +$600K, Total: +$600K. Week 4 (Mar 16-20, SPY 250→230, VIX 82!): Vega: +$30K × 30% IV = +$900K, Total: +$900K. Crisis outcome: Started: $5M, Ended: $7.2M (+44%!), Reason: Positive vega in crisis, delta-neutral hedging. Unhedged disaster scenario: If stayed delta +5,000 throughout: Delta losses: $1.2M (SPY 338 → 218), Total: $5M + $2.2M (vega) - $1.2M (delta) = $6M (+20%), Still profitable but 24% worse than hedged. **Key Lessons**: Delta hedging critical: Prevents catastrophic losses in crash, Positive vega in crisis: Huge benefit (IV expansion), Automated rules save discipline: No emotional decisions, Position limits prevent blow-ups: Never > 5% risk per position.",

    question:
      'Explain "gamma scalping P&L" at the portfolio level. Design a system that: (1) Calculates daily gamma P&L from rehedging, (2) Compares realized volatility to implied volatility to predict profitability, (3) Determines optimal rehedging frequency (continuous vs daily vs threshold-based), (4) Accounts for transaction costs eating into gamma profits, (5) Implements rules for when to add/reduce gamma exposure, (6) Backtest showing gamma scalping performance in different volatility regimes. Provide numerical examples.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Portfolio Gamma Scalping System: **Gamma P&L Formula**: Theoretical: Gamma P&L = 0.5 × Portfolio_Gamma × (Stock_Move)². Intuition: Long gamma → profit from rehedging (buy low, sell high repeatedly). **Realized vs Implied Volatility**: Key insight: Gamma scalping profitable when Realized Vol > Implied Vol, If RV > IV: Gamma profits > option premium paid (theta decay), If RV < IV: Theta decay > gamma profits (lose money). **Profitability Prediction**: Example: Portfolio: Long 1,000 ATM straddles, Gamma: 500, Theta: -$800/day, Implied Vol: 20% (paid for options), Realized Vol scenario 1: 25% (high): Daily moves avg 1.5% = $6.75 on $450 stock, Gamma P&L: 0.5 × 500 × (6.75)² = $11,391/day, Net: $11,391 - $800 = +$10,591/day (profit!). Realized Vol scenario 2: 15% (low): Daily moves avg 0.9% = $4.05, Gamma P&L: 0.5 × 500 × (4.05)² = $4,101/day, Net: $4,101 - $800 = +$3,301/day (still profit, smaller). Realized Vol scenario 3: 10% (very low): Daily moves avg 0.6% = $2.70, Gamma P&L: 0.5 × 500 × (2.70)² = $1,823/day, Net: $1,823 - $800 = +$1,023/day (barely profitable). Break-even RV: Need Gamma P&L = Theta: 0.5 × 500 × move² = $800, move² = 3.2, move = $1.79 on $450 = 0.4% daily = 6.3% annualized (very low!). **Rehedging Frequency**: Option 1 - Continuous (every minute): Pros: Capture every small move, maximize gamma P&L, Cons: Transaction costs prohibitive ($0.01/share × 500 shares × 100 times/day = $500/day!). Option 2 - Daily (once at close): Pros: Low transaction costs ($50/day), Cons: Miss intraday gamma, gap risk overnight. Option 3 - Threshold-based (e.g., every 0.5% move): Pros: Balance gamma capture vs costs, Adaptive to volatility, Cons: More complex to implement, Example: Stock moves 0.5% = $2.25 → trigger rehedge, Costs: If 4 triggers/day = 4 × $50 = $200/day. Optimal: Threshold-based, adjust threshold to volatility regime, High vol (RV > 20%): 0.3% threshold (more frequent), Low vol (RV < 15%): 1.0% threshold (less frequent). **Transaction Cost Impact**: Per rehedge: Commission: $0.50/contract × 100 contracts = $50, Slippage: $0.01/share × 500 shares × 2 (buy+sell) = $10, Total: $60 per rehedge. Daily costs: If 3 rehedges/day: $180/day, Annual: $180 × 252 = $45,360. Impact on P&L: Gross gamma P&L: $11,391/day (from 25% RV), Transaction costs: -$180/day, Theta: -$800/day, Net: $10,411/day = $2.6M/year. Efficiency: (Net / Gross) = 91.4% (lose 8.6% to costs). **Rules for Gamma Management**: ADD GAMMA EXPOSURE when: IV < 20th percentile (cheap options), RV > IV (profitable scalping environment), VIX < 15 (calm market, IV likely to spike), Expectation: Vol expansion upcoming. REDUCE GAMMA EXPOSURE when: IV > 80th percentile (expensive options), RV < IV (losing to theta), Transaction costs > 20% of gross gamma P&L, Post-event (earnings, FOMC): IV crush imminent. **Backtest (2018-2023, 5 years)**: High Vol Regime (2020, RV = 30%, IV = 25%): Gamma P&L: $18K/day, Theta: -$1K/day, Transaction costs: -$250/day, Net: +$16.75K/day × 252 = $4.2M/year (excellent!). Normal Vol Regime (2019, 2021, RV = 15%, IV = 18%): Gamma P&L: $5K/day, Theta: -$800/day, Costs: -$180/day, Net: +$4K/day = $1M/year (good). Low Vol Regime (2017, RV = 10%, IV = 12%): Gamma P&L: $2.2K/day, Theta: -$600/day, Costs: -$180/day, Net: +$1.4K/day = $352K/year (marginal). Overpaid Vol (2018 Q4, RV = 12%, IV = 20%): Gamma P&L: $3K/day, Theta: -$1.2K/day (expensive options), Costs: -$180/day, Net: +$1.62K/day = $408K/year (low, theta eating profits). Overall: 5-year cumulative: +$11.7M on ~$2M capital (585% return), Sharpe: 1.8 (strong risk-adjusted), Worst year: 2018 (+$408K, still positive). **Key Insights**: Gamma scalping ALWAYS profitable if: RV ≥ IV - (Transaction_Costs / Gamma_PLDaily), Best in high vol regimes (2020): 4× returns vs low vol, Transaction costs matter: 5-10% drag on returns, must optimize frequency, Continuous rehedging NOT worth it: Diminishing returns vs costs.',

    question:
      'Design a "vega exposure management strategy" for a portfolio with $100K vega (per 1% IV). The system should: (1) Analyze current vega exposure across positions, (2) Determine if portfolio is over-exposed to IV changes, (3) Implement hedging strategies (add negative vega positions), (4) Create IV scenario analysis (±5%, ±10%, ±20% IV moves), (5) Set vega limits and alerts, (6) Backtest showing how vega management would have protected portfolio during vol crush events (post-earnings, Fed meetings). Provide specific hedging trades.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Vega Exposure Management System: **Current Vega Analysis**: Portfolio vega: $100K per 1% IV, Interpretation: Portfolio gains/loses $100K for every 1% IV move, Exposure: LONG VEGA (benefits from IV increase, hurt by IV decrease). **Position Breakdown**: Assume portfolio: 20 long straddles (high vega), 10 long call calendars (moderate vega), 5 short iron condors (negative vega), Total: +$120K long vega - $20K short vega = $100K net long. Concentration: 60% vega from straddles, 30% from calendars, -10% from iron condors. **Over-Exposure Assessment**: Benchmark vega limits: Conservative: $50K per 1% IV (0.5% of $10M portfolio), Moderate: $100K per 1% IV (1% of portfolio), Aggressive: $200K per 1% IV (2% of portfolio). Current: $100K = MODERATE exposure, Within limits but near ceiling. Risk: 10% IV drop = -$1M (10% portfolio drawdown!), Recommendation: ADD hedges to reduce to $50K-$75K. **Hedging Strategies**: OPTION 1 - Short Strangles: Trade: Sell OTM strangles (add negative vega), Example: Sell 10 SPY 1-month 420p/480c strangles, Vega per strangle: -$25, Total vega reduction: 10 × -$25 = -$25K, New net vega: $100K - $25K = $75K, Credit collected: $500/strangle = $5K total (income!). OPTION 2 - Ratio Spreads: Trade: Add ratio call spreads (sell more than buy), Example: Buy 5 440 calls, sell 10 450 calls, Vega: +$30 (long) - $40 (short) = -$10K net, New vega: $90K. OPTION 3 - Short Butterflies: Trade: Sell butterflies (negative vega at wings), Vega reduction: -$15K per butterfly × 3 = -$45K, New vega: $55K. **Recommended: Option 1 (Short Strangles)**: Pros: Collect premium (income), Most efficient vega reduction, Define risk (use wings if needed). Cons: Directional risk (need to delta hedge), Assignment risk if breached. Implementation: Sell 15 SPY strangles across multiple expirations (30, 45, 60 days), Stagger strikes: 10% OTM ($405p/$495c), 12% OTM ($395p/$505c), Total vega reduction: -$37.5K, New portfolio vega: $62.5K (safer!), Premium collected: $7,500 (offsets theta if needed). **IV Scenario Analysis**: Current portfolio (before hedge, $100K vega): IV -5%: -$500K (ouch!), IV -2%: -$200K, IV flat: $0, IV +2%: +$200K, IV +5%: +$500K, IV +10%: +$1M (jackpot). After hedge ($62.5K vega): IV -5%: -$312.5K (better, 37.5% less loss), IV -2%: -$125K, IV flat: $0, IV +2%: +$125K, IV +5%: +$312.5K, IV +10%: +$625K. **Vega Limits and Alerts**: Set limits: Green zone: $0-$50K vega (low risk), Yellow zone: $50K-$100K vega (moderate, monitor), Red zone: >$100K vega (high risk, hedge immediately). Alerts: Daily: Email with current vega exposure, Threshold: Alert if vega > $90K (approaching red zone), Stress: Alert if IV scenario analysis shows >$500K potential loss. **Backtest: Vol Crush Events**: EVENT 1 - Post-Earnings (e.g., AAPL): Before earnings: Portfolio long $100K vega in AAPL options, IV: 40% (elevated). Earnings announced: Stock moves 3%, but IV drops 40% → 25% (15% vol crush), Unhedged P&L: $100K × (-15%) = -$1.5M loss (disaster!). Hedged P&L ($62.5K vega): $62.5K × (-15%) = -$937K (still bad, but 37.5% less). Lesson: NEVER hold high vega through earnings without hedge. EVENT 2 - Fed Meeting (2022 example): Before FOMC: Portfolio $100K vega, IV: 28%. Fed announces: 50bps hike (expected), IV drops 28% → 22% (6% crush), Unhedged: $100K × (-6%) = -$600K, Hedged: $62.5K × (-6%) = -$375K (saved $225K). EVENT 3 - March 2020 COVID (IV Spike): Before crisis: Portfolio $50K vega (reduced from prior hedge), IV: 15%. Crisis hits: IV spikes 15% → 50% (35% increase!), Hedged P&L: $50K × (+35%) = +$1.75M (huge win!), Unhedged (if $100K vega): +$3.5M (even bigger, but riskier). Trade-off: Hedging costs gains in spikes, but prevents catastrophic losses in crushes. **Backtest Summary (2018-2023)**: Unhedged ($100K vega constant): 2018 Q4 vol crush: -$800K, 2020 vol spike: +$3.5M, 2021 vol crush: -$600K, 2022 vol spike (war): +$1.2M, 2023 calm (net -2% IV): -$200K, Net: +$3.1M but -80% max drawdown! Hedged ($62.5K vega avg): 2018: -$500K, 2020: +$2.2M, 2021: -$375K, 2022: +$750K, 2023: -$125K, Net: +$1.95M with -50% max drawdown (better risk-adjusted!), Sharpe: 1.2 vs 0.8 unhedged. **Dynamic Vega Management**: Adjust vega based on IV regime: Low IV (<20th percentile): Increase vega to $100K+ (IV likely to spike), High IV (>80th percentile): Reduce vega to $25K-$50K (IV likely to crush), Normal: Maintain $50K-$75K (balanced).
