      question: `You're scaling a production LLM application related to building scaling strategy. You've identified a critical bottleneck that's causing performance issues. Analyze the root cause, explain why this is a common problem in scaled systems, && design a comprehensive solution with specific implementation details, monitoring strategies, && expected performance improvements.`,
      answer: `[This answer would be 300-400 words covering:]
      
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Identify the specific bottleneck in the building scaling strategy context
- Explain system behavior under load
- Metrics that indicate the problem
      
**Why This Happens at Scale**:
- Common patterns that emerge at scale
- Trade-offs that become apparent
- Resource constraints && limitations
      
**Comprehensive Solution**:
1. Immediate fixes (stop the bleeding)
2. Short-term optimizations (days to weeks)
3. Long-term architecture changes (months)
      
**Implementation Details**:
- Specific code examples or configuration changes
- Tools && technologies to use
- Step-by-step migration plan
      
**Monitoring & Validation**:
- Key metrics to track
- Alert thresholds
- Success criteria
      
**Expected Results**:
- Performance improvements (latency, throughput)
- Cost impact
- Operational complexity changes`,

      question: `Compare && contrast two different approaches to building scaling strategy (e.g., Strategy A vs Strategy B). Include specific use cases where each approach excels, quantitative comparisons of cost/performance/complexity, && provide a decision framework for choosing between them in production.`,
      answer: `[This answer would be 250-350 words covering:]
      
**Strategy A** (e.g., Approach 1):
- Description && how it works
- Strengths && ideal use cases
- Cost analysis
- Performance characteristics
- Implementation complexity
- Example: "Use for X when Y conditions apply"
      
**Strategy B** (e.g., Approach 2):
- Description && how it works
- Strengths && ideal use cases
- Cost analysis
- Performance characteristics
- Implementation complexity
- Example: "Use for X when Y conditions apply"
      
**Quantitative Comparison**:
| Metric | Strategy A | Strategy B |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Cost | $X/day | $Y/day |
| Latency | Xms | Yms |
| Complexity | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High |
| Scalability | Up to X req/s | Up to Y req/s |
      
**Decision Framework**:
\`\`\`python
if (traffic_pattern == "spiky" && cost_sensitive):
    use Strategy A
elif (need_guaranteed_latency && can_afford):
    use Strategy B
else:
    evaluate hybrid approach
\`\`\`
      
**Real-World Example**:
Application X chose Strategy A because [reasons], resulting in [outcomes]`,

      question: `Design a monitoring && optimization strategy for building scaling strategy in a production LLM application serving 100,000 users. Include specific metrics to track, alert thresholds, optimization opportunities to look for, && a process for continuous improvement. Explain how you would measure ROI of optimizations.`,
      answer: `[This answer would be 300-400 words covering:]
      
**Key Metrics to Track**:
1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Latency (p50, p95, p99)
   - Throughput (requests/second)
   - Error rate
   - Resource utilization

2. **Cost Metrics**:
   - Cost per request
   - Cost per user
   - Total daily/monthly spend
   - Cost breakdown by component

3. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Success rate
   - User satisfaction
   - Specific to building scaling strategy
      
**Alert Thresholds**:
- Warning: > 2 standard deviations from baseline
- Critical: > 3 standard deviations or system impact
- Examples: Latency > 3s, Error rate > 1%, Cost spike > 50%
      
**Optimization Opportunities**:
1. Look for inefficiencies in X
2. Identify over-provisioned resources
3. Find caching opportunities
4. Analyze usage patterns
5. Check for misconfigured parameters
      
**Continuous Improvement Process**:
Week 1: Baseline measurement & analysis
Week 2: Implement optimization A
Week 3: Measure impact & iterate
Week 4: Implement optimization B
Ongoing: Monitor & adjust
      
**ROI Measurement**:
\`\`\`python
baseline_cost = $1000/day
optimized_cost = $600/day
engineering_time = 40 hours
engineer_cost = $100/hour

daily_savings = $400
roi_days = (40 * $100) / $400 = 10 days
monthly_savings = $400 * 30 = $12,000
annual_savings = $12,000 * 12 = $144,000

ROI = (annual_savings - one_time_cost) / one_time_cost
    = ($144,000 - $4,000) / $4,000 = 35x
\`\`\`
      
**Dashboard Design**:
- Real-time metrics
- Historical trends
- Cost attribution
- Optimization opportunities
- Executive summary view`,
