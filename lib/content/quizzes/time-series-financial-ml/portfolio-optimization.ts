    question:
      'Explain Markowitz mean-variance optimization and its limitations in practice.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Markowitz: Maximize Sharpe ratio (return/volatility) subject to weights summing to 1. Finds optimal risk-return tradeoff. Limitations: (1) Sensitive to input estimates (GIGO), (2) Assumes normal returns (fat tails in reality), (3) Static (one period), (4) Transaction costs ignored, (5) Concentrated portfolios. Solutions: Robust optimization, Black-Litterman, regularization, constraints.',

    question: 'What is risk parity? When is it better than maximum Sharpe?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Risk Parity: Each asset contributes equal risk (not equal weight). If asset A has 2x volatility of B, give B 2x weight. Better than max Sharpe when: (1) Diversification important, (2) Estimation uncertainty high, (3) Long-term horizon. Max Sharpe can be concentrated (70% in one asset), risk parity always balanced. Used by Bridgewater All Weather fund.',

    question:
      'How do you incorporate views/predictions into portfolio optimization?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Black-Litterman model: Combine market equilibrium (CAPM) with investor views. Start with market weights, adjust based on predicted outperformance. Example: Predict AAPL +15% next year with 80% confidence. BL blends this with market equilibrium. More confident views get higher weight. Avoids estimation error of pure Markowitz. Widely used by institutional investors.',
