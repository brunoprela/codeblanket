    question:
      'In Mock Interview 1 (Coin Flip Game), explain why the expected value from balance = 0 is exactly $2. Walk through: (1) the recursive equation setup, (2) why symmetry arguments apply, (3) alternative solution methods, (4) how you would handle if interviewer changes to unfair coin (60% heads).',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Complete analysis: (1) Recursive setup: Let E(B) = expected value from balance B. Strategy: stop if B > 0, continue if B ≤ 0. From B=0: E(0) = 1 + 0.5×1 + 0.5×E(-1) (next flip: 50% get to +1 and stop, 50% go to -1 and continue). From B=-1: must eventually return to B=0 (random walk property), so E(-1) = E(0) - 1 (you're $1 behind). Substituting: E(0) = 1 + 0.5 + 0.5×(E(0)-1) = 1.5 + 0.5×E(0) - 0.5 = 1 + 0.5×E(0). Solving: 0.5×E(0) = 1, so E(0) = $2. (2) Symmetry: From any non-positive balance, random walk will eventually reach +1 with certainty (it's a recurrent state). Path doesn't matter, only that you eventually get +1, then +2 with 50% chance, etc. (3) Alternative: Markov chain approach with states {≤-2, -1, 0, +1=terminal}. Or martingale approach: stopped random walk has same expected value as start, but we engineer first positive stopping. (4) Unfair coin (60% heads): Now E(0) = 1 + 0.6×1 + 0.4×E(-1). From symmetry breaking: E(-1) < E(0) - 1. Need to solve: probability of reaching +1 before -∞ from B=-1. With p=0.6: P(eventually reach +1) = (p/q)¹ = (0.6/0.4) = 1.5 (wait, this >1, meaning certain). Recalculate: E(-1) = 1 + 0.4×E(-2) + 0.6×E(0). This becomes more complex; with p>0.5, expected value from any state is finite and positive. Approximate: E(0) ≈ $4-5 (better than fair coin).",

    question:
      'In Mock Interview 2 (Options Arbitrage), the interviewer asks: "What if transaction costs are $0.02 per option contract and $0.01 per share? Does arbitrage still exist?" Analyze: (1) revised P&L calculation, (2) minimum mispricing needed for profitable arbitrage, (3) position sizing considerations, (4) risks in practice.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Complete transaction cost analysis: (1) Revised P&L: Original mispricing: calls overpriced by $2 (C-P should be $0, is $2). Transaction costs per unit: Buy put: $3 + $0.02 = $3.02. Sell call: $5 - $0.02 = $4.98. Buy stock: $100 + $0.01 = $100.01. Total outflow: $100.01 - $4.98 + $3.02 = $98.05. At expiration receive: $100. Profit: $100 - $98.05 = $1.95. YES, arbitrage still exists! Profit reduced from $2.00 to $1.95 (2.5% reduction). (2) Minimum mispricing for profitability: Need C-P-S+K > transaction_costs. Total transaction costs = $0.02 + $0.02 + $0.01 = $0.05. Minimum mispricing: $0.05 + (profit margin) = ~$0.10 minimum. Below this, risk and execution costs dominate. (3) Position sizing: With $1.95 profit per unit, need large size for meaningful returns. If capital = $1M and each arb requires $98, max positions ≈ 10,200 units = $19,890 profit. But consider: borrowing costs for stock purchase, margin requirements (need ~$30-50/unit margin), opportunity cost of capital. ROI: $19,890 / $1M = 1.99% for 1-month hold ≈ 24% annualized (good!). (4) Practical risks: Execution risk (might not fill all legs simultaneously), pin risk at expiration (if stock exactly at $100), early exercise of put (American options), dividend risk (affects put-call parity), model risk (options might be fairly priced with different assumptions). Real arbitrageurs need: automated execution, low latency, counterparty relationships, risk management systems.',

    question:
      'In Mock Interview 3 (First Ace Problem), interviewer asks: "What if we draw until we get both a red ace AND a black ace? What\'s the expected number of draws?" Provide: (1) problem setup and states, (2) recursive equations, (3) solution method, (4) simulation verification code.',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Extended first-ace problem: (1) Problem setup: 2 red aces, 2 black aces, 48 other cards. Need to draw until we've seen at least one red ace AND at least one black ace. States: (N,N) = seen neither red nor black ace. (R,N) = seen red, not black. (N,B) = seen black, not red. (R,B) = seen both (terminal). (2) Recursive equations: Let E(s) = expected draws from state s. From (N,N): draw one card. Outcomes: red ace (prob 2/52), black ace (2/52), other (48/52). E(N,N) = 1 + (2/52)×E(R,N) + (2/52)×E(N,B) + (48/52)×E(N,N). From (R,N): need black ace. E(R,N) = 1 + (2/51)×0 + (49/51)×E(R,N) [continuing from R,N state with 51 cards left]. Solving E(R,N): E(R,N) = 1 + (49/51)×E(R,N) → E(R,N) = 51/2 = 25.5. By symmetry: E(N,B) = 25.5. Substituting into E(N,N): E(N,N) = 1 + (2/52)×25.5 + (2/52)×25.5 + (48/52)×E(N,N) = 1 + (4/52)×25.5 + (48/52)×E(N,N). Solving: (4/52)×E(N,N) = 1 + (4/52)×25.5 = 1 + 1.96 = 2.96. E(N,N) = 2.96 × 52/4 = 38.5. Wait, let me recalculate more carefully. E(R,N) calculation assumes we stay in R state, but drawing another red ace doesn't change state. More precisely: from (R,N) with k cards left (2-r red aces, b black aces, others): E = 1 + (b/k)×0 + ((k-b)/k)×E(continuing). E(R,N starting) = 52/(2+1) = 17.33 [using (n+1)/(k+1) formula for remaining 2 black aces out of 50 remaining]. Better: E(N,N) ≈ 35-40 draws. (3) Simulation: [code below] (4) Code: def draw_until_both(): deck = ['RA']*2 + ['BA']*2 + ['X']*48; random.shuffle (deck); red, black = False, False; for i, card in enumerate (deck,1): if card=='RA': red=True; elif card=='BA': black=True; if red and black: return i.
