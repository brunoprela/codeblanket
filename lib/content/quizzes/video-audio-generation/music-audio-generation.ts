    question:
      'Design a music generation system for video games that creates adaptive soundtracks responding to gameplay intensity, location, and player actions. How would you ensure smooth transitions between musical states while maintaining coherent composition?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Adaptive game music system: 1) Define music states (exploration, tension, combat, victory) each with base loops, 2) Generate layered stems for each state using MusicGen (percussion, melody, harmony, bass), 3) Implement smooth crossfading between states (2-4 beats overlap, use musical timing), 4) Add dynamic variation (intensity parameter 0-1 controls layers active and effects). Technical approach: pre-generate 30-60 second loops per state at different intensities, use real-time audio engine (FMOD/Wwise) for mixing, implement state machine for transitions with cooldown periods (avoid rapid switching), add randomization for variation without repetition. Challenges: maintaining key/tempo consistency across states (generate all in same key, use tempo-matching), smooth transitions (crossfade on beat boundaries, use DSP effects for blending), memory constraints (stream from disk, keep hot states in RAM). Implementation: generate base tracks offline with MusicGen, create transition matrices defining valid state changes, use intensity curves for gradual changes, test with gameplay data to tune responsiveness. Quality metrics: transition smoothness (no audible clicks/pops), musical coherence (stays in key, rhythmically consistent), player immersion scores, memory footprint <100MB active audio.',

    question:
      'Compare text-to-music generation with melody-conditioned generation for creating background music for content creators. What are the advantages and limitations of each approach, and how would you build a system that combines both?',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Text-to-music: uses prompts like 'upbeat electronic dance music' to generate complete tracks. Advantages: easy for non-musicians, creative exploration, generates everything from description. Limitations: less control over specific melodies, harder to match existing brand sound, can be generic. Melody-conditioned: user provides melody (hummed, MIDI, audio) and model generates full arrangement. Advantages: precise melodic control, can recreate existing songs' style, maintains brand identity. Limitations: requires musical input, limited to melody variations, user needs some music knowledge. Hybrid system: 1) Start with text description for genre/mood/instrumentation, 2) Optional melody upload for specific melodic content, 3) Style reference audio for timbral matching, 4) Iterative refinement (regenerate specific instruments). Architecture: use MusicGen for text→music, MusicGen melody model for melody conditioning, style transfer for matching reference timbre. UI workflow: text prompt → generates candidate → user can add melody → regenerate with melody constraint → adjust individual instruments → export. Use cases: pure text-to-music for exploration/drafts, melody-conditioned for brand consistency, hybrid for commercial content. Implementation: cache text-only generations, allow melody overlay without full regeneration, provide MIDI export for further editing, integrate with DAWs via plugin. Cost optimization: text generation $0.10-0.50 per track, melody conditioning 20% more expensive but higher success rate.",

    question:
      'Explain how you would build a sound effects library generator that creates variations of common sound effects (footsteps, doors, ambient sounds) with controllable parameters. How would you ensure consistent quality and appropriate sound for different contexts?',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Sound effects generation system: 1) Category taxonomy (footsteps, impacts, ambience, mechanical, nature), 2) Parameter spaces per category (footsteps: surface type, shoe type, pace, weight), 3) AudioGen for base generation, 4) Variation generation through parameter interpolation, 5) Quality filtering and tagging. Implementation: define prompt templates with parameter slots ('heavy boots on wooden floor, slow pace'), generate 10-20 variations per parameter combination, automated quality scoring (duration appropriateness, spectral characteristics, no artifacts), manual review samples, tag with metadata. Example: footsteps category - surfaces (wood, concrete, grass, gravel, metal), shoes (boots, sneakers, heels), weights (light, normal, heavy), paces (walk, run, tiptoe) = 5×4×3×3 = 180 base combinations, 5 variations each = 900 sound effects. Quality assurance: automated checks (duration 0.2-1.0s for single footstep, energy in expected frequency range, no clipping), similarity scoring (variations should differ but not too much), A/B testing with sound designers, remove artifacts using spectral analysis. Organization: hierarchical file structure, SQLite database with metadata (category, parameters, duration, sample rate, tags), search by semantic similarity using embeddings, auto-generate preview mixes. Production: batch generation overnight (GPU costs ~$50 for 1000 effects), manual quality review next day, iterate on failed categories, publish as asset packs. Challenges: maintaining realism (some combinations don't occur in real life), consistency across variations, storage (1000 effects × 5 variations × 100KB = 500MB), licensing/rights for AI-generated audio.",
