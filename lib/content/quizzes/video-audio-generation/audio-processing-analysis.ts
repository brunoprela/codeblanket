    question:
      'Design a complete audio preprocessing pipeline for a podcast hosting platform that automatically enhances uploaded audio quality, removes noise, normalizes levels, and generates transcripts. How would you handle diverse input quality and provide users with before/after comparisons?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Automated podcast preprocessing pipeline: 1) Input validation (check format, duration, sample rate), 2) Quality assessment (SNR, dynamic range, clipping detection), 3) Noise reduction using spectral gating (analyze first 2s for noise profile), 4) Speech enhancement (bandpass filter 80Hz-8kHz, de-essing, compression), 5) Loudness normalization to -16 LUFS, 6) Silence trimming at start/end, 7) Chapter marker detection (silence >1s), 8) Transcription with Whisper. Handle diverse quality: classify audio quality (pristine, good, noisy, poor), apply appropriate processing strength per tier, skip enhancement for pristine to avoid artifacts, use aggressive processing only when needed. Before/after comparison: generate 30-second preview clips at key moments (start, middle, end), waveform visualization showing dynamic range changes, spectral comparison plots, A/B player in UI. Fallback: if enhancement worsens quality (checked via objective metrics like PESQ), use original. Processing time: ~1x audio duration on CPU, 0.3x on GPU. Cost: $0.02 per hour of audio. Implementation: async queue with progress updates, store intermediate steps for debugging, allow manual override of settings, collect feedback to improve auto-detection. Quality metrics: SNR improvement, dynamic range, integrated loudness (LUFS), user satisfaction rating.',

    question:
      'Explain how you would build a music stem separation service that separates songs into vocals, drums, bass, and other instruments. What are the technical challenges with different music genres and how would you provide value beyond just separation?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Music stem separation service: 1) Use Spleeter or Demucs (state-of-the-art), 2) Support 2-stem (vocals/accompaniment), 4-stem (vocals/drums/bass/other), and 5-stem models, 3) Post-separation enhancement (denoise each stem, EQ to remove bleeding), 4) Quality assessment per stem, 5) Export in multiple formats. Technical challenges: genre-specific issues (electronic music with synthesized drums harder than live drums, heavily compressed music bleeds more, extreme panning affects separation), temporal artifacts (phase issues at stem boundaries), computational cost (4-minute song takes 30-60s on GPU). Value-added features: 1) Karaoke generation (remove vocals, normalize), 2) Remix tools (adjust stem volumes, apply effects), 3) Music practice (isolate instrument to learn), 4) Sample extraction (clean drum hits), 5) Mashup creation (combine stems from different songs). Quality improvements: run multiple models and blend results, use source separation + enhancement pipeline, temporal smoothing across stems, phase alignment between stems. Business model: freemium (2-stem free, 4-stem paid), bulk pricing for DJs/producers, API for integration, educational licenses. Implement real-time preview (process first 30s quickly), show spectrum analysis per stem, provide mix-minus feature (all stems except one), enable stem re-synthesis check (stems sum to original).',

    question:
      'Design an audio analysis system that can automatically detect and classify different types of audio content (speech, music, ambient noise, silence) and extract relevant metadata. How would this be useful for content indexing and search?',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Audio content classification system: 1) Frame-level classification (10ms windows) using CNN trained on speech/music/noise/silence, 2) Temporal smoothing (median filter over 1s), 3) Segment extraction (group consecutive frames of same class), 4) Detailed feature extraction per segment type. For speech: transcription (Whisper), speaker count (diarization), language detection, emotion analysis (speech prosody), topic extraction (LLM on transcript). For music: genre classification, tempo detection, key/mode, mood (valence/arousal), instrument detection, vocal presence, era estimation. For ambient: scene classification (nature, urban, indoor), acoustic properties (reverb, space size). Metadata database: segment-level annotations (start/end time, class, confidence, features), hierarchical tags, embedding vectors for similarity search. Applications: 1) Content search ('find all podcast episodes with happy music'), 2) Automated content warning (detect explicit language/themes), 3) Copyright detection (audio fingerprinting of music segments), 4) Accessibility (auto-generate descriptions 'upbeat music plays'), 5) Recommendations (find similar audio based on feature similarity), 6) Ad insertion (identify optimal points between speech segments). Technical implementation: process in streaming fashion (low memory), extract features to SQLite, index embeddings in vector DB (FAISS/Pinecone), API for search queries. Quality metrics: classification accuracy >95% for clear segments, F1 >0.90 for segment boundary detection, search relevance measured by user click-through rates.",
