    question:
      'Design a scalable text-to-speech service using ElevenLabs that handles voice cloning, multi-language support, and emotion control. How would you manage costs when generating thousands of audio clips per day while maintaining quality and low latency?',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Scalable TTS architecture: 1) Semantic caching layer (embed prompts, cache similar requests with 95%+ similarity), 2) Voice library management (clone voices once, reuse across projects), 3) Smart batching (group requests by voice/language for efficiency), 4) Progressive generation (stream audio as it generates for perceived speed), 5) CDN delivery for generated audio. Cost management: ElevenLabs charges per character (~$0.00018/char for Creator tier), so 1M characters = $180. Strategies: 1) Aggressive caching (estimated 20-40% cache hit rate saves $36-72/day on 1M chars), 2) Text preprocessing (remove repeated whitespace, optimize punctuation), 3) Chunking long texts (only regenerate changed sections), 4) Tiered service (lower quality/faster model for previews), 5) Volume discounts (negotiate custom pricing >10M chars/month). Latency optimization: use turbo_v2 model for streaming (latency <500ms first chunk), maintain hot connections to API, implement request coalescing. Quality control: validate audio length matches expected duration, check for artifacts, A/B test voice settings per use case. Monitor: cost per generation, cache hit rate, average latency, error rate, user satisfaction scores.',

    question:
      'Explain how you would build an audiobook generation system that uses voice cloning to create a consistent narrator voice, handles different character dialogue with distinct voices, and manages chapter-by-chapter generation with proper pacing and emotion.',
    sampleAnswer:
      'Audiobook generation pipeline: 1) Text preprocessing: parse ebook (EPUB/PDF), detect chapter boundaries, identify dialogue vs narration, tag character names. 2) Voice assignment: narrator voice (clone from sample), character voices (select from library or generate unique voices per character). 3) Emotion detection: analyze text context to determine emotional tone (dialogue tags, punctuation, surrounding text) and adjust voice settings accordingly. 4) Generation strategy: process chapter-by-chapter (enables parallel processing and failure recovery), split long chapters into 5-minute segments, generate with appropriate voice and emotion settings. 5) Post-processing: normalize audio levels across chapters, add chapter markers, insert silence at chapter boundaries (2 seconds), master for consistent loudness (-16 LUFS). Technical implementation: detect dialogue with regex patterns (quotes, dialogue tags), map characters to voices using NER + consistency tracking, adjust voice parameters per emotion (stability: 0.7 for calm, 0.3 for excited), use sentence-level generation for fine control, cache commonly used phrases. Challenges: maintaining voice consistency across long generation sessions (use same settings + seed), handling ambiguous dialogue attribution (fall back to narrator voice), managing generation costs (avg 100k characters per book = $18-25), ensuring natural pacing (add pauses at punctuation). Quality checks: voice consistency score >0.90, emotion appropriateness (manual review samples), pronunciation accuracy for character names.',

    question:
      'Compare streaming TTS with batch generation for different use cases. Design a system that intelligently chooses between approaches based on user requirements and system load. How would you implement fallback mechanisms?',
    sampleAnswer:
      "Streaming TTS: generates and delivers audio in chunks as text is processed, latency <1s for first audio, ideal for real-time applications (voice assistants, live chat). Limitations: slightly lower quality, no global optimization, harder to cache. Batch TTS: generates complete audio before delivery, higher quality through global optimization, easier to cache, better for known content. Latency: 5-30s depending on length. Intelligent routing system: Consider use case (real-time conversation vs content creation), text length (<100 words favor streaming, >500 words favor batch), system load (high load routes quick requests to streaming), caching potential (repeat content uses batch + cache), quality requirements (production content uses batch). Implementation: ```python\ndef select_generation_mode(text, use_case, system_load):\n    if use_case == 'realtime':\n        return 'streaming'\n    if len(text.split()) < 100 and system_load < 0.8:\n        return 'streaming' \n    if is_in_cache(text):\n        return 'cached'\n    return 'batch'\n``` Fallback mechanisms: 1) Streaming timeout (>10s) → switch to batch, 2) Batch queue too long (>2min wait) → offer streaming alternative, 3) API error → retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts), then switch mode, 4) Quality issues → regenerate with different settings, 5) Service degradation → local TTS fallback (lower quality but functional). Monitor mode selection accuracy, user satisfaction by mode, cost per mode, quality metrics (MOS scores). A/B test thresholds for optimal routing decisions.",
