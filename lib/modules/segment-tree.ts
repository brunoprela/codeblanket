      content: `**Segment Tree** is a tree data structure for storing intervals (segments). It allows efficient querying and updating of array intervals.

**Problem it Solves:**
Given an array, perform these operations efficiently:
- **Range Query**: Find sum/min/max/gcd of elements in range [L, R]
- **Point Update**: Update a single element
- **Range Update**: Update all elements in a range (with lazy propagation)

**Why Segment Trees:**
- Range queries: O(log N) instead of O(N)
- Point updates: O(log N) instead of O(1) simple array
- Balance between query and update efficiency

**When to Use:**
- Multiple range queries on static or dynamic arrays
- Need both queries and updates
- Range sum, min, max, GCD, etc.
- Problems with intervals/segments

**Alternative Data Structures:**
- **Prefix Sum**: Fast queries (O(1)) but can't handle updates
- **Fenwick Tree**: Simpler, but limited to associative operations
- **Sqrt Decomposition**: Simpler but slower (O(âˆšN))`,

            'Segment Tree reduces range query time from O(N) to O(log N). For example, finding the sum of a range in a simple array requires iterating through all elements, but Segment Tree precomputes and stores ranges, allowing you to combine at most log N nodes to answer any query.',

**Array Representation:**
Store tree in array of size 4N (to be safe).

tree = [0] * (4 * n)

**Index Mapping:**
- Node i has:

**Use Segment Tree when:**
- Multiple **range queries** on array
- Need **both queries and updates**
- Queries are sum/min/max/gcd
- Can't use simpler approaches

**Keywords:**
- "Range sum/min/max queries"
- "Efficient updates and queries"
- "Interval queries"
- "Dynamic array with queries"

**Problem-Solving Steps:**

**1. Identify if Segment Tree is Needed:**
- Can you use prefix sums? (query-only)
- Can you use Fenwick tree? (simpler, if applicable)
- Do you really need O(log N) for both operations?

**2. Choose Operation Type:**
- Sum? Min? Max? GCD?
- Point update or range update?
- Need lazy propagation?

**3. Implementation Strategy:**
- Start with basic point update
- Add range updates later if needed
- Test with small examples

**4. Edge Cases:**
- Single element array
- Query entire array
- Update and immediate query
- Multiple updates to same position

**Interview Tips:**
- Mention simpler alternatives first
- Explain why you need segment tree
- Draw tree structure for small example
- Discuss complexity trade-offs
- Code recursively (cleaner)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to update parent nodes
- Wrong merge function
- Index calculations (2*i+1, 2*i+2)
- Not handling no-overlap case correctly
- Forgetting lazy propagation push`,

          sampleAnswer:
            'Use recursive implementation in interviews unless you are very comfortable with iterative. Recursive is more intuitive, easier to explain, and less error-prone. Iterative can be faster and saves stack space, but is harder to get right under pressure. Most interviewers prefer correct recursive code over buggy iterative code.',
