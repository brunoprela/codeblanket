      content: `A **linked list** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored non-contiguously in memory. Each node contains:
1. **Data** - the value stored
2. **Next pointer** - reference to the next node
3. **(Optional) Prev pointer** - for doubly linked lists

**Advantages over Arrays:**
- **Dynamic size**: Grows/shrinks as needed, no resizing
- **Efficient insertion/deletion**: O(1) at known positions
- **No wasted space**: Only allocates what's needed

**Disadvantages:**
- **No random access**: O(N) to access element at index i
- **Extra memory**: Pointers require additional space
- **Poor cache locality**: Nodes scattered in memory

**Types of Linked Lists:**

**1. Singly Linked List**
\`\`\`
[1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí [4] ‚Üí None
\`\`\`
- One-directional traversal
- Each node has one \`next\` pointer

**2. Doubly Linked List**
\`\`\`
None ‚Üê [1] ‚áÑ [2] ‚áÑ [3] ‚áÑ [4] ‚Üí None
\`\`\`
- Bidirectional traversal
- Each node has \`next\` and \`prev\` pointers
- More memory but more flexible

**3. Circular Linked List**
\`\`\`
[1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí [4] ‚Æå
\`\`\`
- Last node points back to first
- No \`None\` termination
- Useful for round-robin scheduling

**Python Implementation:**
\`\`\`python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

# Create a linked list: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3
head = ListNode(1)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(3)
\`\`\`

**When to Use Linked Lists:**
- Frequent insertions/deletions at the beginning
- Unknown/dynamic size
- Implementing stacks, queues, hash tables (chaining)
- **Interview problems** involving pointer manipulation`,

          question:
            'Explain the fundamental difference between linked lists and arrays. What trade-offs do you make when choosing one over the other?',
          sampleAnswer:
            'The fundamental difference is memory layout and access pattern. Arrays store elements contiguously in memory with O(1) random access by index - I can jump to any element instantly. Linked lists store elements as nodes scattered in memory, connected by pointers, with O(n) access - I must traverse from head to reach an element. Arrays have better cache locality, making them faster for sequential access. Linked lists excel at insertions and deletions, especially at the beginning: O(1) vs O(n) for arrays which must shift elements. The trade-off: arrays for fast access and iteration, linked lists for dynamic size and frequent insertions/deletions. Memory overhead: arrays have minimal overhead, linked lists need extra pointer storage per node.',

          sampleAnswer:
            'To insert a new node after a given node, I create the new node, set its next pointer to point to the current node next, then update the current node next to point to the new node. This is just two pointer updates, so O(1) time once I have the reference. The key is "once you have the reference" - finding the insertion point takes O(n) traversal. But if I already have a pointer to the node, insertion is constant time because I am only changing pointers, not shifting elements like in arrays. For example, to insert B between A and C: B.next = A.next (B points to C), then A.next = B (A points to B). No other nodes are affected.',

This simplifies edge cases because now the head is no longer special - I can insert or delete at the head using the same logic as any other position. Without a dummy, I need special case handling when the head changes. For example, deleting the first node requires updating the head pointer separately. With a dummy, deleting the first node is just dummy.next = dummy.next.next, same as any deletion. At the end, return dummy.next as the new head.

      content: `**Pattern 1: Two Pointers (Fast & Slow)**

**Use Cases:**
- Detect cycles
- Find middle of list
- Find kth from end

**Visualization - Find Middle:**
\`\`\`
Initial:
slow, fast
   ‚Üì    ‚Üì
[1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí [4] ‚Üí [5] ‚Üí None

Step 1:
     slow   fast
       ‚Üì      ‚Üì
[1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí [4] ‚Üí [5] ‚Üí None

Step 2:
          slow        fast
            ‚Üì           ‚Üì
[1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí [4] ‚Üí [5] ‚Üí None

fast reaches end, slow is at middle!

       ‚Üê  ‚Üê  ‚Üê  ‚Üê [5]

Fast and slow will meet inside the cycle!
\`\`\`

**Pattern 2: Dummy Node**

Use a dummy/sentinel node to simplify edge cases.

**Without Dummy (Complex):**
\`\`\`python
if not head:
    return None
if head.val == target:
    return head.next
# ... more cases
\`\`\`

**With Dummy (Simple):**
\`\`\`python
dummy = ListNode(0)
dummy.next = head
prev = dummy
# ... uniform logic for all cases
return dummy.next
\`\`\`

**Visualization:**
\`\`\`
Original:  [1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3]
With dummy: [0] ‚Üí [1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3]
             ‚Üë
           dummy
\`\`\`

---

**Pattern 3: Reverse Pointers**

Reverse links by manipulating \`next\` pointers.

**Visualization:**
\`\`\`
Original:  [1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí None

Step 1:
None ‚Üê [1]  [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí None
 ‚Üë     ‚Üë    ‚Üë
prev  curr next

Step 2:
None ‚Üê [1] ‚Üê [2]  [3] ‚Üí None
       ‚Üë     ‚Üë    ‚Üë
      prev  curr next

Step 3:
None ‚Üê [1] ‚Üê [2] ‚Üê [3]
              ‚Üë     ‚Üë
             prev  curr

Result: [3] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [1] ‚Üí None
\`\`\`

---

**Pattern 4: Runner Technique**

Use two pointers moving at different speeds or positions.

**Find Kth from End:**
\`\`\`
K = 2

Step 1: Move first pointer K steps ahead
[1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí [4] ‚Üí [5] ‚Üí None
 ‚Üë           ‚Üë
second     first

Step 2: Move both until first reaches end
[1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí [4] ‚Üí [5] ‚Üí None
            ‚Üë                 ‚Üë
          second            first

second is now K from end!
\`\`\`

**Pattern 5: Merge Technique**

Merge two sorted lists by comparing heads.

**Visualization:**
\`\`\`
List1: [1] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí [5]
List2: [2] ‚Üí [4] ‚Üí [6]

Compare 1 vs 2: take 1
[1] ‚Üí ...
Compare 3 vs 2: take 2
[1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí ...
Compare 3 vs 4: take 3
[1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí ...

Result: [1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí [4] ‚Üí [5] ‚Üí [6]

For example, in list 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí5, when fast reaches 5, slow is at 3. This is elegant because we find the middle in one pass without knowing the length beforehand.

Think of it like a circular track: the faster runner will lap the slower runner. If no cycle, fast reaches null. Once they meet, we know a cycle exists. To find the cycle start, reset one pointer to head and move both one step at a time - they meet at the cycle entrance. This works due to mathematical properties of the distances.

**Space Complexity:**

**Singly Linked List:**
- Per node: O(1) - one pointer
- Total: O(N) for N nodes

**Doubly Linked List:**
- Per node: O(2) - two pointers
- Total: O(2N) = O(N) for N nodes

**Recursive Operations:**
- Stack space: O(N) for call stack
- Example: Recursive reverse uses O(N) space

**Common Problem Complexities:**

**Reverse Linked List:**
- Iterative: Time O(N), Space O(1)
- Recursive: Time O(N), Space O(N)

**Detect Cycle:**
- Floyd's: Time O(N), Space O(1)
- Hash Set: Time O(N), Space O(N)

**Merge Two Lists:**
- Iterative: Time O(N+M), Space O(1)
- Recursive: Time O(N+M), Space O(N+M)

**Merge K Sorted Lists:**
- Naive: Time O(NK) where K is number of lists
- Min Heap: Time O(N log K), Space O(K)
- Divide & Conquer: Time O(N log K), Space O(log K)

**Find Middle:**
- Two pointers: Time O(N), Space O(1)
- Count then traverse: Time O(N), Space O(1)

**Key Insights:**
- Linked lists trade access time (O(N)) for insertion/deletion efficiency (O(1))
- Many problems can be solved in O(1) space using pointer manipulation
- Recursive solutions use O(N) extra space for call stack`,

          sampleAnswer:
            'Inserting at head is O(1) because we have direct access to the head pointer - create new node, point it to current head, update head to new node. Done. Inserting at tail is O(n) because we must traverse the entire list to find the last node, then append. Each step of traversal takes constant time but we need n steps. However, if we maintain a tail pointer, insertion at tail becomes O(1) too - just update tail.next and move tail pointer. The difference comes from whether we need to search for the insertion point or have direct access to it. This is why doubly linked lists with tail pointers are more versatile.',

For example, recursive reverse: we recursively call on next node, storing current node on each frame, until we reach the end, then unwind the stack updating pointers.

Space is O(1) because we only need two pointer variables, regardless of list size. Compare to hash set approach: also O(n) time but O(n) space to store visited nodes.

We need three because we must simultaneously reverse the current link and advance forward. If we only had two pointers and did curr.next = prev, we would lose access to the rest of the list.

            'After fast and slow meet in a cycle, reset one pointer to head and keep the other at meeting point. Move both one step at a time - they will meet at the cycle start. The math: let distance from head to cycle start be x, distance from start to meeting point be y, and remaining cycle be z. When they meet, slow traveled x+y, fast traveled x+y+z+y (went around once more). Since fast is twice as fast, 2(x+y) = x+y+z+y, simplifying to x = z. So distance from head to start equals distance from meeting point to start. This elegant property lets us find the start with O(1) space. Beautiful application of algebra to pointer manipulation.',

I systematically avoid this by always checking: "if curr and curr.next" before accessing curr.next.next.

For example, moving head forward in a loop: "head = head.next" loses the start. Without dummy, you need a separate variable to save original head. Dummy node prevents this by keeping a fixed reference before the real head. I work with dummy.next and never move dummy itself.

**Use Linked List techniques when you see:**
- "Linked list" explicitly mentioned
- "Node" with "next" pointer
- Problems about "reversing", "merging", "detecting cycles"
- "In-place" with O(1) space requirement
- "Find middle", "kth from end"
- "Reorder" or "rearrange" nodes

---

**Problem-Solving Steps:**

**Step 1: Clarify the Problem**
- Singly or doubly linked?
- Can we modify in-place?
- What's the format of input/output?
- Any dummy nodes or sentinel values?

**Step 2: Identify the Pattern**
- **Two pointers?** ‚Üí Fast & slow, cycle detection, middle finding
- **Reversal?** ‚Üí Iterative or recursive reverse
- **Merging?** ‚Üí Merge sorted lists
- **Reordering?** ‚Üí Find pattern, possibly reverse part
- **Cycle?** ‚Üí Floyd's algorithm
- **Kth from end?** ‚Üí Runner technique

**Step 3: Handle Edge Cases**
- Empty list (\`head == None\`)
- Single node (\`head.next == None\`)
- Two nodes
- All same values
- Cycle vs. no cycle

**Step 4: Choose Approach**
- **Iterative** (usually O(1) space)
- **Recursive** (simpler but O(N) space)
- **With/without dummy node**

**Step 5: Trace Through Example**
Draw the list and pointers at each step:
\`\`\`
Initial: [1] ‚Üí [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí None
Step 1:  None ‚Üê [1]  [2] ‚Üí [3] ‚Üí None
Step 2:  None ‚Üê [1] ‚Üê [2]  [3] ‚Üí None
Final:   None ‚Üê [1] ‚Üê [2] ‚Üê [3]
\`\`\`

**Interview Communication:**

1. **Clarify:**
   - "Is this a singly or doubly linked list?"
   - "Can I modify the list in place?"

2. **Explain approach:**
   - "I'll use two pointers: fast moves 2 steps, slow moves 1 step."
   - "When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the middle."

3. **Discuss alternatives:**
   - "Recursively would be cleaner but uses O(N) space."
   - "Iteratively is O(1) space but slightly more complex."

4. **Handle edge cases:**
   - "For empty list, I'll return None immediately."
   - "For single node, no work needed, return head."

5. **Complexity analysis:**
   - "Time: O(N) since we traverse once."
   - "Space: O(1) using only pointers, no extra data structures."

---

**Common Follow-ups:**

**Q: Can you do it in O(1) space?**
- Avoid hash sets/maps
- Use pointer manipulation instead

**Q: Can you do it without modifying the input?**
- Create new nodes
- Or note that you're modifying in-place

**Q: What if there are multiple cycles?**
- Typically only one cycle in problems
- But clarify assumptions

**Q: Can you do it recursively?**
- Show both iterative and recursive
- Discuss tradeoffs

Second, sequential access patterns without random access needs - traversing one by one. Third, frequent insertions or deletions, especially at beginning or middle. Fourth, problems involving cycles, finding middle, or nth from end - these are classic linked list patterns. Fifth, memory-constrained problems where you cannot use arrays. The key question: does the problem require pointer manipulation or sequential traversal with O(1) space? If accessing by index is not needed and modifications are frequent, linked list techniques apply. Even if input is array, thinking in linked list terms can help.',

          sampleAnswer:
            'First, I clarify: is it singly or doubly linked? Can I modify in-place? Are there cycles? Then I identify the pattern: is it reversal, cycle detection, two pointers, or merging? I explain my approach: "I will use fast and slow pointers to find the middle in one pass". I discuss complexity: "O(n) time for one traversal, O(1) space with just two pointers". Then I draw a small example on paper or whiteboard, showing pointer movements step by step. While coding, I explain: "I initialize dummy node to handle edge cases, then..." After coding, I trace through edge cases: empty list, single node, two nodes. I mention optimizations or alternative approaches. Clear visualization and edge case handling are crucial.',

Fourth: forgetting edge cases like empty list or single node. I test these mentally before finishing. Fifth: creating cycles accidentally by incorrect pointer updates. I carefully track which pointers I am changing. Sixth: using wrong loop condition, causing infinite loops. I ensure progress in every iteration.
