      title: 'What is the Two Pointers Technique?',
      content: `The Two Pointers technique is a powerful algorithmic pattern that uses **two pointers** to traverse a data structure (typically an array or string) in a clever way to solve problems efficiently. Instead of using nested loops that lead to O(n¬≤) time complexity, two pointers can often reduce this to O(n).

**The Core Concept:**
Use two references (pointers) to traverse your data structure. The pointers can:
- Start at opposite ends and move toward each other
- Both start at the beginning but move at different speeds
- Define a window that slides through the data

**Why Two Pointers?**
Many problems that seem to require checking all pairs (O(n¬≤)) can be solved more efficiently by maintaining two positions and making smart decisions about which pointer to move.

**Real-World Analogy:**
Imagine two people searching through a sorted list of prices to find two items that sum to your budget. One starts from the cheapest items, the other from the most expensive. If the sum is too high, the person at expensive items moves down. If too low, the person at cheap items moves up. They meet in the middle with the answer - much faster than checking every possible pair!

**When Does Two Pointers Work?**
- When dealing with sorted or sortable data
- When you need to find pairs/triplets with certain properties
- When working with palindromes or symmetric patterns
- When you need to partition or reorder array elements
- When tracking a window of elements with specific constraints`,

          sampleAnswer:
            'The two pointers technique avoids the need for nested loops by making smart decisions about which pointer to move based on the data structure properties. In a nested loop approach, you check every possible pair which is n √ó n operations. With two pointers, you traverse the array just once - each pointer moves through the array at most n times total, giving you O(n). The key is that we can eliminate checking certain pairs because we have information - like if the array is sorted, or if we have found duplicates. We make progress with every pointer movement instead of checking all combinations.',

- Finding pairs that sum to a target
- Palindrome checking
- Reversing arrays/strings
- Container with most water

**Classic Problem:** Two Sum in Sorted Array
- If sum too small ‚Üí move left pointer right (increase sum)
- If sum too large ‚Üí move right pointer left (decrease sum)
- If sum equals target ‚Üí found it!

**Pattern 2: Same Direction (Fast & Slow Pointers)**

**When to Use:**

- Partitioning arrays
- Cycle detection in linked lists
- Finding middle element

**Classic Problem:** Remove Duplicates

- Copy unique elements from fast to slow position

**Pattern 3: Sliding Window**

I use this for sorted array problems like two sum - if the sum is too high, move the right pointer left, if too low, move left pointer right. Second is same direction where both pointers start at the beginning but move at different speeds. This is perfect for removing duplicates - slow pointer marks where to write next unique element, fast pointer scans ahead to find it.

For two sum, if the current sum is too large, I know I need a smaller number, so I move the right pointer left to get smaller values. If the sum is too small, I need a larger number, so I move the left pointer right. The key insight is that moving the wrong pointer makes things worse - if sum is already too big and I move left pointer right, I am adding an even larger number.

We need two because we are modifying the array in place - we cannot use one pointer to both read ahead and mark where to write. Fast pointer scans through the array looking for elements different from what slow is pointing to. When fast finds something new, we copy it to slow plus one position and move slow forward.

      title: 'Detailed Algorithm Walkthrough',
      content: `**Example: Two Sum in Sorted Array**

**Problem:** Given sorted array and target sum, find two numbers that add up to target.

**Brute Force Approach: O(n¬≤)**
\`\`\`python
for i in range(len(nums)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
            return [i, j]
# Checks every pair - slow!
\`\`\`

**Two Pointers Approach: O(n)**

**Step-by-Step with Example:**
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11], Target: 14

\`\`\`
Step 1: Initialize
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
 L              R
Sum = 1 + 11 = 12 < 14 ‚Üí Need larger sum ‚Üí Move L right

Step 2:
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
    L           R
Sum = 3 + 11 = 14 == 14 ‚Üí FOUND!
\`\`\`

**Why This Works:**
1. Array is sorted, so:
   - Moving left pointer RIGHT increases the sum
   - Moving right pointer LEFT decreases the sum
2. We systematically explore valid possibilities
3. We never need to backtrack
4. Each element checked at most once

**Example: Remove Duplicates In-Place**

**Problem:** Remove duplicates from sorted array, return new length.

**Visual Walkthrough:**
\`\`\`
Original: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]

Step 1:
[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
 S  F
nums[S] == nums[F], F moves

Step 2:
[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
 S     F
nums[S] != nums[F], S++, copy nums[F] to nums[S]

Step 3:
[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
    S     F
nums[S] == nums[F], F moves

Step 4:
[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
    S        F
nums[S] != nums[F], S++, copy nums[F] to nums[S]

Result:
[1, 2, 3, ...]

Length = S + 1 = 3

      title: 'Time & Space Complexity Analysis',
      content: `**Time Complexity: O(n)**

**Why Linear Time?**
- Each pointer moves through the array at most once
- In opposite direction pattern: combined movement covers array once
- In same direction pattern: fast pointer covers array once
- No nested loops required!

**Comparison with Brute Force:**

| Approach | Time | Space | Array Size 1000 |
|----------|------|-------|-----------------|
| Brute Force (nested loops) | O(n¬≤) | O(1) | 1,000,000 ops |
| Two Pointers | O(n) | O(1) | 1,000 ops |

**The Difference is Massive:**
- For n = 1,000: 1000x faster
- For n = 10,000: 10,000x faster
- For n = 100,000: 100,000x faster

**Space Complexity: O(1)**
- Only use two pointer variables
- Modify array in-place when needed
- No additional data structures
- Constant extra memory regardless of input size

**Detailed Analysis by Pattern:**

**1. Opposite Direction:**
- Time: O(n) - each element visited once
- Space: O(1) - two pointer variables
- Pointers move total of n times combined

**2. Same Direction:**
- Time: O(n) - fast pointer goes through array once
- Space: O(1) - two pointer variables
- Slow pointer always behind fast pointer

**3. Sliding Window:**
- Time: O(n) - each element enters and leaves window once
- Space: O(1) for basic window, O(k) if storing window elements
- Amortized O(1) per element

**When Complexity Increases:**
- If operation at each step is expensive: O(n √ó k)
- If storing window elements: Space becomes O(window_size)
- If sorting is needed first: Time becomes O(n log n)

**Practical Performance:**
Beyond Big-O notation:
- Cache-friendly: sequential access pattern
- Low overhead: minimal extra variables
- Parallelizable: in some cases
- In-place: doesn't require extra memory`,

For each element at index i, I treat it as the first number and then use two pointers to find two other numbers that sum to target minus that first number. So outer loop fixes one element, inner two pointers solve "two sum equals target minus first element". The two pointers work just like regular two sum - start at ends, move based on whether sum is too big or small. Key detail: I need to skip duplicates at all three levels to avoid duplicate triplets.

      content: `**Recognition Patterns:**

Ask yourself these questions to identify two pointer problems:

**1. "Do I need to find pairs/triplets?"**
- If yes and sorted/sortable ‚Üí Opposite direction pointers

**2. "Do I need to modify array in-place?"**
- Removing elements ‚Üí Same direction pointers
- Partitioning ‚Üí Fast/slow pointers

**3. "Am I looking at subarrays/substrings?"**
- Fixed size window ‚Üí Sliding window with fixed gap
- Variable size window ‚Üí Expanding/shrinking window

**4. "Is there a two-pass O(n¬≤) solution?"**
- Often can be optimized to O(n) with two pointers

**Step-by-Step Approach:**

**Step 1: Clarify (30 seconds)**
- "Is the input sorted?" (Crucial!)
- "Can I modify the input?"
- "What should I return?"
- "Are there duplicates?"

**Step 2: Choose Pattern (30 seconds)**
- Sorted + pairs? ‚Üí Opposite direction
- Modify in-place? ‚Üí Same direction  
- Window problem? ‚Üí Sliding window

**Step 3: Explain Approach (1-2 minutes)**
- State which pattern you're using
- Explain why it's better than brute force
- Mention time/space complexity

**Step 4: Code (5-7 minutes)**
- Initialize pointers correctly
- Write clear loop condition
- Handle pointer movement logic
- Consider edge cases

**Step 5: Test (2-3 minutes)**
Test these cases:
- Empty/single element input
- All elements same
- Target at boundaries
- No valid answer
- Multiple valid answers

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

**1. Wrong Initialization**
‚ùå \`left, right = 0, len(nums)\` // right should be len(nums) - 1
‚úÖ \`left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\`

**2. Infinite Loops**
‚ùå Forgetting to move pointers
‚úÖ Always ensure at least one pointer moves each iteration

**3. Off-by-One Errors**
‚ùå \`while left <= right\` when should be \`left < right\`
‚úÖ Think carefully about when pointers can be equal

**4. Not Handling Duplicates**
- For 3Sum, need to skip duplicate values
- For unique pairs, need extra checks

**5. Wrong Pointer Movement**
- In container problem, move the shorter height
- In partition, be careful which pointer to move

**Interview Follow-Ups:**

**Q: "Can you do it without extra space?"**
A: Two pointers is already O(1) space - emphasize this advantage

**Q: "What if array is not sorted?"**
A: "I can sort it first in O(n log n), still better than O(n¬≤)"

**Q: "Can you extend to 4Sum?"**
A: "Yes, fix two elements and use two pointers for other two"

**Q: "What about cycle detection in linked list?"**
A: "Use fast and slow pointers - Floyd's algorithm"

**Practice Roadmap:**

**Week 1: Master Basics**
1. Two Sum (sorted array)
2. Remove duplicates
3. Valid palindrome
4. Container with most water

**Week 2: Intermediate**
5. 3Sum
6. Trapping rain water
7. Longest substring without repeating chars
8. Minimum window substring

**Week 3: Advanced**
9. 4Sum
10. Linked list cycle detection
11. Dutch national flag
12. Merge sorted arrays

**Time Management:**
- Spend 2-3 minutes planning before coding
- Should complete easy problems in 10-15 minutes
- Medium problems in 15-25 minutes
- Don't rush - correct code beats fast wrong code!`,
