            content: `**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** explores a graph or tree level by level, visiting all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.

**Core Concept:**
- Start at a node
- Visit all immediate neighbors first (go wide)
- Then visit neighbors of neighbors
- Continue level by level

**Key Characteristics:**
- Uses a **queue** (FIFO - First In, First Out)
- Explores **layer by layer**
- **Finds shortest path** in unweighted graphs
- Visits nodes in order of distance from start

**BFS vs DFS:**
- **BFS**: Queue â†’ Goes wide â†’ O(W) space â†’ Shortest path
- **DFS**: Stack/Recursion â†’ Goes deep â†’ O(H) space â†’ All paths

**When to Use BFS:**
- **Shortest path** in unweighted graphs
- **Level-order** traversal of trees
- **Nearest neighbor** problems
- **Minimum number of steps/moves**
- Finding nodes at specific distance
- Web crawling (breadth-first)`,

Then node Y on that path at distance d-1 would have enqueued X at distance d, contradiction (X already discovered). For example, graph Aâ†’B, Aâ†’C, Bâ†’D, Câ†’D: BFS from A discovers B,C at distance 1, then D at distance 2 via both paths. First discovery is shortest.

            content: `**Graph BFS** finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs and explores connected components.

**Key Differences from Tree BFS:**
- Must track **visited nodes** (graphs have cycles)
- Can start from any node
- May need to handle disconnected components

**Basic Graph BFS Template:**
\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node)  # Process node
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
\`\`\`

**Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph:**
\`\`\`python
def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    if start == end:
        return 0
    
    visited = {start}
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    
    while queue:
        node, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor == end:
                return dist + 1
            
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
    
    return -1  # No path exists
\`\`\`

**Shortest Path with Parent Tracking:**
\`\`\`python
def shortest_path_with_route(graph, start, end):
    if start == end:
        return [start]
    
    visited = {start}
    queue = deque([start])
    parent = {start: None}
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        if node == end:
            # Reconstruct path
            path = []
            curr = end
            while curr is not None:
                path.append(curr)
                curr = parent[curr]

                parent[neighbor] = node
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return []  # No path

\`\`\`python
def multi_source_bfs(graph, sources):
    """
    BFS starting from multiple sources simultaneously.
    Useful for problems like "distance from nearest X"
    """
    visited = set(sources)

            content: `**BFS guarantees shortest path** in unweighted graphs because it explores nodes in order of increasing distance.

**Why BFS Finds Shortest Path:**
1. Explores all nodes at distance k before distance k+1
2. First time you reach a node = shortest path to that node
3. Works only for **unweighted** graphs (all edges cost 1)

**Standard Shortest Path Template:**
\`\`\`python
def shortest_path_bfs(graph, start, end):
    if start == end:
        return 0
    
    visited = {start}
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    
    while queue:
        node, distance = queue.popleft()
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor == end:
                return distance + 1
            
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, distance + 1))
    
    return -1  # Unreachable
\`\`\`

**With Path Reconstruction:**
\`\`\`python
def shortest_path_with_reconstruction(graph, start, end):
    if start == end:
        return [start]
    
    visited = {start}
    queue = deque([start])
    parent = {start: None}
    
    # BFS to find end
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                parent[neighbor] = node
                queue.append(neighbor)
                
                if neighbor == end:
                    # Reconstruct path
                    path = []
                    curr = end
                    while curr is not None:
                        path.append(curr)
                        curr = parent[curr]
                    return path[::-1]
    
    return []  # No path
\`\`\`

**Grid Shortest Path (4-directional):**
\`\`\`python
def shortest_path_grid(grid, start, end):
    """
    Find shortest path in 2D grid.
    0 = walkable, 1 = blocked
    """
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = {start}
    queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 0)])
    
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    while queue:
        r, c, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if (r, c) == end:
            return dist
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            
            if (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and
                grid[nr][nc] == 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited):
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
    
    return -1  # Unreachable
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
- **First visit = shortest path** (in unweighted graphs)
- Use **visited set** to avoid cycles
- Track **distance or parent** for path reconstruction
- For weighted graphs, use Dijkstra instead`,

            content: `**Recognizing BFS Problems:**

**Keywords to watch for:**
- "Shortest path/distance"
- "Minimum number of steps/moves"
- "Level by level"
- "Nearest/closest"
- "Layer by layer"
- "Each turn/round"

**BFS vs DFS Decision:**

**Use BFS when:**
- Need **shortest path** (unweighted)
- **Level-order** traversal required
- Find **nearest/closest** element
- **Minimum steps** to reach goal
- Width likely < height

**Use DFS when:**
- Need to explore **all paths**
- **Tree traversal** (preorder/inorder/postorder)
- **Backtracking** problems
- Path finding (not shortest)
- Height likely < width

**Problem-Solving Framework:**

**1. Identify the Graph:**
- Explicit graph (adjacency list/matrix)?
- Implicit graph (grid, state space)?
- Tree or general graph?

**2. Determine What to Track:**
- Just visit nodes? â†’ Simple BFS
- Count distance/steps? â†’ Track distance
- Reconstruct path? â†’ Track parent
- Process levels? â†’ Track level size

**3. Choose Data Structures:**
- Queue: Standard BFS
- Deque: 0-1 BFS
- Set: Visited nodes
- Dict: Parent tracking / distances

**4. Handle Edge Cases:**
- Empty input
- Start = end
- No path exists
- Disconnected components

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting visited set (infinite loop!)
- Not marking visited before adding to queue
- Incorrect level-by-level processing
- Using DFS when shortest path needed
- Not handling disconnected components

**Interview Tips:**
- Always mention time/space complexity
- Discuss BFS vs DFS trade-offs
- Draw small example and trace through
- Mention optimizations (bidirectional, 0-1)
- Handle edge cases explicitly`,

Signals: unweighted graph + shortest, tree + level-order, minimum steps in state space. For example, "shortest path maze" â†’ BFS (each move costs 1). "Binary tree level order" â†’ BFS natural fit. "Minimum moves to solve puzzle" â†’ BFS on state graph. If "shortest" with weighted â†’ Dijkstra not BFS. If exploring all paths â†’ DFS. If shortest unweighted â†’ always BFS.',

Sixth: using BFS for weighted graphs (need Dijkstra). My strategy: 1) Always use queue (collections.deque in Python). 2) Mark visited when enqueuing neighbor. 3) Mark start before loop. 4) For components, loop through all unvisited nodes. 5) Track level: count nodes per level or store (node, level) in queue. 6) Unweighted only.
