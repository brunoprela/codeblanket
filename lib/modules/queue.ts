            content: `A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** principle. Think of it like a line at a store - the first person in line is the first to be served.

**Why Queues Matter:**
- **Natural Model:** Represents real-world waiting scenarios
- **BFS Algorithm:** Essential for breadth-first search in trees and graphs
- **Task Scheduling:** Used in operating systems, printers, and job schedulers
- **Data Processing:** Buffering, streaming, message queues

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Operating Systems:** Process scheduling, task queues
- **Web Servers:** Request handling queues
- **Printers:** Print job queues
- **Customer Service:** Call center queues
- **Gaming:** Event queues, multiplayer matchmaking
- **Networking:** Packet queues in routers

**Key Insight:**
While Stack is Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), Queue is First-In-First-Out (FIFO). This makes queues perfect for scenarios where order of arrival matters and fairness is important.`,

In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end (top). Queue preserves order of arrival, while stack reverses it. Example: Queue [1,2,3] removes 1 first; Stack [1,2,3] removes 3 first.',

            content: `## Core Queue Operations

A queue supports two fundamental operations:

### 1. **Enqueue (Add to rear)**
Add an element to the back of the queue.
\`\`\`python
queue.enqueue(item)  # Add item to rear
\`\`\`

### 2. **Dequeue (Remove from front)**
Remove and return the front element.
\`\`\`python
item = queue.dequeue()  # Remove from front
\`\`\`

### 3. **Peek/Front** (Optional but common)
View the front element without removing it.
\`\`\`python
item = queue.front()  # View front element
\`\`\`

### 4. **isEmpty** (Check if empty)
\`\`\`python
if queue.is_empty():
    print("Queue is empty")
\`\`\`

### 5. **Size** (Get number of elements)
\`\`\`python
length = queue.size()
\`\`\`

## Implementation Methods

There are three main ways to implement a queue in Python:

### Method 1: Using List (Simple but Inefficient)

‚ùå **Not recommended for production** - dequeue is O(n)

\`\`\`python
class QueueWithList:
    """Queue using Python list (inefficient)"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def enqueue(self, item):
        """Add to rear - O(1)"""
        self.items.append(item)
    
    def dequeue(self):
        """Remove from front - O(n) ‚ùå SLOW!"""
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("Dequeue from empty queue")
        return self.items.pop(0)  # O(n) - shifts all elements!
    
    def front(self):
        """Peek at front - O(1)"""
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
        return self.items[0]
    
    def is_empty(self):
        """Check if empty - O(1)"""
        return len(self.items) == 0
    
    def size(self):
        """Get size - O(1)"""
        return len(self.items)

# Usage
queue = QueueWithList()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
queue.enqueue(3)
print(queue.dequeue())  # 1 (FIFO!)
print(queue.front())    # 2
\`\`\`

**Problem:** \`pop(0)\` is O(n) because it shifts all remaining elements left!

---

### Method 2: Using collections.deque (Recommended) ‚úÖ

**Best choice** - All operations O(1)

\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

class Queue:
    """Queue using deque (double-ended queue) - BEST IMPLEMENTATION"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = deque()  # Optimized for both ends
    
    def enqueue(self, item):
        """Add to rear - O(1)"""
        self.items.append(item)  # Append to right
    
    def dequeue(self):
        """Remove from front - O(1) ‚úÖ FAST!"""
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("Dequeue from empty queue")
        return self.items.popleft()  # Pop from left - O(1)!
    
    def front(self):
        """Peek at front - O(1)"""
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
        return self.items[0]
    
    def is_empty(self):
        """Check if empty - O(1)"""
        return len(self.items) == 0
    
    def size(self):
        """Get size - O(1)"""
        return len(self.items)
    
    def __repr__(self):
        """String representation"""
        return f"Queue({list(self.items)})"

# Usage
queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
queue.enqueue(3)
print(queue)            # Queue([1, 2, 3])
print(queue.dequeue())  # 1
print(queue.dequeue())  # 2
print(queue.front())    # 3
\`\`\`

**Why deque is best:**
- \`append()\` is O(1) for adding to rear
- \`popleft()\` is O(1) for removing from front
- Implemented as doubly-linked list internally
- This is what professionals use!

---

### Method 3: Using Two Stacks (Interview Favorite)

Sometimes asked in interviews: "Implement a queue using two stacks"

\`\`\`python
class QueueWithStacks:
    """Queue implemented using two stacks"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack_in = []   # For enqueue
        self.stack_out = []  # For dequeue
    
    def enqueue(self, item):
        """Add to rear - O(1)"""
        self.stack_in.append(item)
    
    def dequeue(self):
        """Remove from front - O(1) amortized"""
        # Move elements from stack_in to stack_out if needed
        if not self.stack_out:
            while self.stack_in:
                self.stack_out.append(self.stack_in.pop())
        
        if not self.stack_out:
            raise IndexError("Dequeue from empty queue")
        
        return self.stack_out.pop()
    
    def front(self):
        """Peek at front - O(1) amortized"""
        if not self.stack_out:
            while self.stack_in:
                self.stack_out.append(self.stack_in.pop())
        
        if not self.stack_out:
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
        
        return self.stack_out[-1]
    
    def is_empty(self):
        """Check if empty - O(1)"""
        return not self.stack_in and not self.stack_out

# How it works:
# stack_in:  [1, 2, 3] (top is 3)
# stack_out: []
# 
# On dequeue:
# 1. Pop all from stack_in to stack_out: [3, 2, 1] (top is 1)
# 2. Pop from stack_out returns 1 (first enqueued!)
# 
# Subsequent dequeues just pop from stack_out until empty
\`\`\`

## Complexity Comparison

| Operation | List | deque | Two Stacks |
|-----------|------|-------|------------|
| Enqueue | O(1) | **O(1)** | O(1) |
| Dequeue | ‚ùå O(n) | **O(1)** | O(1) amortized |
| Front | O(1) | **O(1)** | O(1) amortized |
| Space | O(n) | **O(n)** | O(n) |

**Recommendation:** Use \`collections.deque\` for real applications. Know the two-stacks approach for interviews.`,

            title: 'Queue Variations',
            content: `## Common Queue Variations

Beyond the basic queue, there are several important variations used in different scenarios.

---

## 1. Circular Queue (Ring Buffer)

A fixed-size queue where the rear connects back to the front, reusing space efficiently.

**Use Case:** Fixed-size buffers, streaming data

\`\`\`python
class CircularQueue:
    """Fixed-size circular queue"""
    
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.queue = [None] * capacity
        self.front = 0
        self.rear = 0
        self.size = 0
    
    def enqueue(self, item):
        """Add to rear"""
        if self.is_full():
            raise IndexError("Queue is full")
        
        self.queue[self.rear] = item
        self.rear = (self.rear + 1) % self.capacity  # Wrap around
        self.size += 1
    
    def dequeue(self):
        """Remove from front"""
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
        
        item = self.queue[self.front]
        self.front = (self.front + 1) % self.capacity  # Wrap around
        self.size -= 1
        return item
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return self.size == 0
    
    def is_full(self):
        return self.size == self.capacity
    
    def __repr__(self):
        """Show queue contents"""
        if self.is_empty():
            return "CircularQueue([])"
        
        items = []
        index = self.front
        for _ in range(self.size):
            items.append(self.queue[index])
            index = (index + 1) % self.capacity
        
        return f"CircularQueue({items})"

# Usage
cq = CircularQueue(3)
cq.enqueue(1)
cq.enqueue(2)
cq.enqueue(3)
print(cq)  # CircularQueue([1, 2, 3])

print(cq.dequeue())  # 1
cq.enqueue(4)  # Reuses space from 1!
print(cq)  # CircularQueue([2, 3, 4])
\`\`\`

**Key Feature:** Wraps around using modulo: \`(index + 1) % capacity\`

---

## 2. Priority Queue

Elements have priorities; highest priority element is dequeued first, not FIFO.

**Use Case:** Task scheduling, Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search

\`\`\`python
import heapq

class PriorityQueue:
    """Priority queue using heap"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []
        self.count = 0  # For tie-breaking
    
    def enqueue(self, item, priority):
        """Add with priority (lower number = higher priority)"""
        # Tuple: (priority, count, item)
        # count ensures FIFO for same priority
        heapq.heappush(self.heap, (priority, self.count, item))
        self.count += 1
    
    def dequeue(self):
        """Remove highest priority item"""
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("Queue is empty")
        
        priority, _, item = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        return item
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.heap) == 0
    
    def size(self):
        return len(self.heap)

# Usage
pq = PriorityQueue()
pq.enqueue("Low priority task", priority=3)
pq.enqueue("High priority task", priority=1)
pq.enqueue("Medium priority task", priority=2)

print(pq.dequeue())  # "High priority task" (priority 1)
print(pq.dequeue())  # "Medium priority task" (priority 2)
print(pq.dequeue())  # "Low priority task" (priority 3)
\`\`\`

**Note:** Priority queue is technically a heap, not a queue! But it's called a queue because of the similar interface.

---

## 3. Deque (Double-Ended Queue)

Can add/remove from both ends efficiently.

**Use Case:** Sliding window problems, undo/redo, palindrome checking

\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

# Deque supports operations on both ends!
dq = deque([1, 2, 3])

# Add to right (rear)
dq.append(4)          # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Add to left (front)
dq.appendleft(0)      # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Remove from right
dq.pop()              # Returns 4 ‚Üí [0, 1, 2, 3]

# Remove from left
dq.popleft()          # Returns 0 ‚Üí [1, 2, 3]

# All operations are O(1)!
\`\`\`

**Key Point:** Regular queue is one-way (rear in, front out). Deque is two-way (both ends).

---

## 4. Blocking Queue (Thread-Safe)

Thread-safe queue for concurrent programming.

**Use Case:** Producer-consumer pattern, multithreading

\`\`\`python
from queue import Queue  # Python's thread-safe queue
import threading

# Thread-safe queue
q = Queue(maxsize=10)  # Optional size limit

# Producer thread
def producer():
    for i in range(5):
        q.put(i)  # Blocks if queue is full
        print(f"Produced {i}")

# Consumer thread
def consumer():
    for _ in range(5):
        item = q.get()  # Blocks if queue is empty
        print(f"Consumed {item}")
        q.task_done()

# Start threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=producer)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=consumer)
t1.start()
t2.start()
t1.join()
t2.join()
\`\`\`

**Features:**
- \`put()\` blocks when full
- \`get()\` blocks when empty
- Thread-safe operations
- Good for producer-consumer patterns

---

## Comparison Table

| Type | Add | Remove | Use Case |
|------|-----|--------|----------|
| **Regular Queue** | Rear | Front | BFS, basic FIFO |
| **Circular Queue** | Rear (wrap) | Front (wrap) | Fixed buffers |
| **Priority Queue** | By priority | Highest priority | Scheduling, Dijkstra |
| **Deque** | Both ends | Both ends | Sliding window |
| **Blocking Queue** | Thread-safe | Thread-safe | Multithreading |

---

## When to Use Each

**Regular Queue:** Default choice for BFS, task processing

**Circular Queue:** When you have fixed memory and want to reuse space

**Priority Queue:** When some items are more important than others

**Deque:** When you need efficiency at both ends (sliding window, palindrome)

**Blocking Queue:** When coordinating between threads

**Pro Tip:** For most LeetCode/interview problems, \`collections.deque\` is your best friend!`,

This reuses space from dequeued elements instead of shifting array elements or growing the array. Both front and rear pointers wrap around. This is efficient for fixed-size buffers where we want O(1) enqueue/dequeue without wasted space or expensive shifts.',

When window slides: remove expired indices from front (popleft), remove smaller values from rear before adding new (pop). Both operations are O(1) with deque.

            content: `## Essential Queue Patterns

Recognizing these patterns helps you identify when to use a queue.

---

## Pattern 1: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Most important queue application!**

BFS explores nodes level by level, using a queue to track which nodes to visit next.

\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

def bfs_tree(root):
    """BFS traversal of binary tree"""
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])  # Start with root
    
    while queue:
        # Process current level
        node = queue.popleft()  # FIFO!
        result.append(node.val)
        
        # Add children to queue (next level)
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)
    
    return result

# Why queue works:
# Process nodes in order discovered
# Level 0: [root]
# Level 1: [root.left, root.right]
# Level 2: [children of level 1 nodes]
\`\`\`

**Key Insight:** Queue ensures we process all nodes at depth d before any node at depth d+1.

---

## Pattern 2: Level-Order Traversal

Process tree level by level, keeping levels separate.

\`\`\`python
def level_order(root):
    """Return list of lists, one per level"""
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)  # Current level size
        level = []
        
        # Process entire level
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level.append(node.val)
            
            # Add next level
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        result.append(level)
    
    return result

# Example:
#       1
#      / \\
#     2   3
#    / \\
#   4   5
#
# Returns: [[1], [2, 3], [4, 5]]
\`\`\`

**Pattern:** Use \`len(queue)\` to know how many nodes are at current level.

## Pattern 3: Sliding Window Maximum

Use deque to efficiently track maximum in sliding window.

\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

def max_sliding_window(nums, k):
    """Find max in each window of size k"""
    result = []
    dq = deque()  # Store indices
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Remove indices outside window
        while dq and dq[0] < i - k + 1:
            dq.popleft()
        
        # Remove smaller elements (they can't be max)
        while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < nums[i]:
            dq.pop()
        
        dq.append(i)
        
        # Add to result once window is full
        if i >= k - 1:
            result.append(nums[dq[0]])  # Front is max
    
    return result

# Example: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
# Result: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
\`\`\`

**Key:** Deque maintains decreasing order - front is always maximum.

---

## Pattern 4: Recent Counter

Count requests in last N milliseconds using queue.

\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

class RecentCounter:
    """Count requests in last 3000ms"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.requests = deque()
    
    def ping(self, t):
        """Add request at time t, return count in [t-3000, t]"""
        self.requests.append(t)
        
        # Remove requests older than t - 3000
        while self.requests and self.requests[0] < t - 3000:
            self.requests.popleft()
        
        return len(self.requests)

# Usage
counter = RecentCounter()
print(counter.ping(1))     # 1 (request at t=1)
print(counter.ping(100))   # 2 (requests at t=1, 100)
print(counter.ping(3001))  # 3 (all within window)
print(counter.ping(3002))  # 3 (t=1 is now outside window)
\`\`\`

**Pattern:** Use queue as sliding time window - remove old entries as you add new ones.

---

## Pattern 5: Implement Stack Using Queues

Classic interview problem!

\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

class StackUsingQueues:
    """Implement stack using two queues"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.q1 = deque()
        self.q2 = deque()
    
    def push(self, x):
        """Push to stack - O(1)"""
        self.q1.append(x)
    
    def pop(self):
        """Pop from stack - O(n)"""
        # Move all but last to q2
        while len(self.q1) > 1:
            self.q2.append(self.q1.popleft())
        
        # Remove last (top of stack)
        result = self.q1.popleft()
        
        # Swap queues
        self.q1, self.q2 = self.q2, self.q1
        
        return result
    
    def top(self):
        """Peek at top - O(n)"""
        # Similar to pop but add back
        while len(self.q1) > 1:
            self.q2.append(self.q1.popleft())
        
        result = self.q1[0]
        self.q2.append(self.q1.popleft())
        
        self.q1, self.q2 = self.q2, self.q1
        
        return result

# Usage
stack = StackUsingQueues()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)
print(stack.pop())  # 3 (LIFO!)
print(stack.top())  # 2
\`\`\`

**Trick:** Use two queues and rotate to access last element.

## Pattern Recognition Guide

**Use Queue when:**
- ‚úÖ Processing in order of arrival
- ‚úÖ BFS / level-order traversal
- ‚úÖ Sliding window with FIFO
- ‚úÖ Task scheduling
- ‚úÖ Buffering / streaming

**Use Stack when:**
- ‚ùå Need LIFO (last-in-first-out)
- ‚ùå DFS / backtracking
- ‚ùå Function calls / recursion
- ‚ùå Undo/redo (if single-ended)

**Use Deque when:**
- ‚úÖ Need efficiency at both ends
- ‚úÖ Sliding window maximum/minimum
- ‚úÖ Palindrome checking
- ‚úÖ Can't decide between queue and stack!

**Remember:** If the problem mentions "level by level", "breadth-first", "order of arrival", or "FIFO" ‚Üí think Queue!`,

Understanding the performance characteristics of queue operations is crucial for choosing the right implementation.

## Operation Complexities

### Using collections.deque (Recommended):

| Operation | Time | Explanation |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Enqueue** | O(1) | \`append()\` adds to rear in constant time |
| **Dequeue** | O(1) | \`popleft()\` removes from front in constant time |
| **Front/Peek** | O(1) | Access first element directly |
| **isEmpty** | O(1) | Check length |
| **Size** | O(1) | Return length |
| **Space** | O(n) | n elements stored |

**All operations are O(1)** - This is why deque is the best choice!

---

### Using List (NOT Recommended):

| Operation | Time | Explanation |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Enqueue** | O(1) | \`append()\` is O(1) |
| **Dequeue** | ‚ùå **O(n)** | \`pop(0)\` shifts all elements |
| **Front** | O(1) | \`list[0]\` is O(1) |
| **Space** | O(n) | n elements stored |

**Dequeue is O(n)** - This makes list unsuitable for queues!

---

### Using Two Stacks:

| Operation | Time | Amortized | Explanation |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Enqueue** | O(1) | O(1) | Push to stack_in |
| **Dequeue** | O(n) worst | **O(1)** amortized | Pop from stack_out, transfer if needed |
| **Front** | O(n) worst | **O(1)** amortized | Peek at stack_out, transfer if needed |
| **Space** | O(n) | O(n) | Two stacks |

**Amortized O(1)** - Expensive transfers are rare, averaged out over time.

---

## Amortized Analysis Example

Why is two-stacks queue O(1) amortized?

\`\`\`python
# Worst case scenario:
queue = QueueWithStacks()

# 1. Enqueue n items - O(n) total
for i in range(n):
    queue.enqueue(i)  # Each O(1)

# stack_in: [0,1,2,...,n-1]
# stack_out: []

# 2. First dequeue - O(n) because transfer all n items
queue.dequeue()  # Moves all n items from stack_in to stack_out

# stack_in: []
# stack_out: [n-1,...,2,1,0]

# 3. Next n-1 dequeues - O(1) each!
for _ in range(n-1):
    queue.dequeue()  # Just pop from stack_out

# Total cost: n enqueues + n dequeues = n + (n transfer + n pops) = 3n
# Average per operation: 3n / 2n = 1.5 = O(1) amortized!
\`\`\`

**Key Insight:** Each element is moved at most twice (stack_in ‚Üí stack_out), so total work is O(1) per element on average.

---

## Space Complexity

### Regular Queue:
\`\`\`python
space = O(n)  # n elements in queue
\`\`\`

### BFS with Queue:
\`\`\`python
def bfs(root):
    queue = deque([root])  # Space: O(width of tree)
    # ...

# Worst case: O(n) if tree is very wide
# Example: complete binary tree last level has n/2 nodes
\`\`\`

### Queue in Sliding Window:
\`\`\`python
def sliding_window_max(nums, k):
    dq = deque()  # Space: O(k) max
    # ...

# Space is bounded by window size k, not array size n
\`\`\`

---

## Performance Tips

**1. Use deque, not list:**
\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå BAD - O(n) dequeue
queue = []
queue.append(1)
first = queue.pop(0)  # O(n)!

# ‚úÖ GOOD - O(1) dequeue
from collections import deque
queue = deque()
queue.append(1)
first = queue.popleft()  # O(1)!
\`\`\`

**2. Pre-allocate for fixed-size queues:**
\`\`\`python
# For circular queue, pre-allocate array
queue = [None] * capacity  # Better than dynamic growth
\`\`\`

**3. Batch operations when possible:**
\`\`\`python
# If adding multiple items
queue.extend([1, 2, 3, 4])  # More efficient than 4 individual appends
\`\`\`

---

## Common Complexity Mistakes

‚ùå **Mistake 1:** Thinking list is O(1) for queue
\`\`\`python
queue = []
queue.pop(0)  # This is O(n), not O(1)!
\`\`\`

‚ùå **Mistake 2:** Forgetting BFS space complexity
\`\`\`python
# BFS can have O(n) space if tree is wide!
# Not always O(log n) like DFS
\`\`\`

‚ùå **Mistake 3:** Creating new deque in loop
\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå BAD - O(n¬≤) total
for i in range(n):
    queue = deque()  # Creates new deque each time!

# ‚úÖ GOOD - O(n) total
queue = deque()
for i in range(n):
    # Reuse same queue
\`\`\`

---

## Complexity Cheat Sheet

**Basic Operations:**
- Enqueue: O(1) with deque
- Dequeue: O(1) with deque
- Peek: O(1)

**BFS Complexity:**
- Time: O(V + E) for graphs (visit all vertices and edges)
- Space: O(W) where W is maximum width

**Level-Order Traversal:**
- Time: O(n) - visit each node once
- Space: O(w) - w is maximum width of level

**Sliding Window:**
- Time: O(n) - process each element once
- Space: O(k) - k is window size

**Remember:** Always use \`collections.deque\` for O(1) operations on both ends!`,

---

## Problem-Solving Framework

### Step 1: Identify if Queue is Needed

Ask yourself:
- Do I need to process items in order they arrive? (FIFO)
- Am I doing BFS or level-order traversal?
- Do I need to track a sliding window?
- Is this about shortest path (unweighted)?

### Step 2: Choose Queue Type

\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

# Most common: regular deque
queue = deque()

# Circular queue with size limit
class CircularQueue:
    def __init__(self, k):
        self.queue = [None] * k
        # ...

# Priority queue (not really a queue!)
import heapq
pq = []  # Use heap

# Deque for sliding window
dq = deque()  # Can use both ends
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Write Solution Template

**BFS Template:**
\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

def bfs(start):
    """Standard BFS template"""
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = {start}
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        
        # Process current
        # ...
        
        # Add neighbors
        for neighbor in get_neighbors(current):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return result
\`\`\`

**Level-Order Template:**
\`\`\`python
def level_order(root):
    """Process tree level by level"""
    if not root:
        return []
    
    queue = deque([root])
    result = []
    
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)  # Key: capture level size
        level = []
        
        for _ in range(level_size):  # Process entire level
            node = queue.popleft()
            level.append(node.val)
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        result.append(level)
    
    return result
\`\`\`

**Sliding Window Template:**
\`\`\`python
def sliding_window(nums, k):
    """Sliding window with deque"""
    dq = deque()
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Remove out-of-window elements
        while dq and dq[0] < i - k + 1:
            dq.popleft()
        
        # Maintain deque property (e.g., decreasing for max)
        while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < nums[i]:
            dq.pop()
        
        dq.append(i)
        
        # Add to result once window is full
        if i >= k - 1:
            result.append(nums[dq[0]])
    
    return result
\`\`\`

## Communication Tips

**What to say during the interview:**

1. **Identify the pattern:**
   > "This is a level-order traversal problem, so I'll use a queue for BFS."

2. **Explain FIFO:**
   > "I'm using a queue because we need to process nodes in the order we discover them."

3. **Discuss implementation:**
   > "I'll use collections.deque for O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations."

4. **Walk through example:**
   > "Starting with the root in the queue, we dequeue it, process it, then enqueue its children..."

5. **Mention complexity:**
   > "Time is O(n) since we visit each node once. Space is O(w) where w is the maximum width."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Mistake 1:** Using list instead of deque
\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå BAD - O(n) per dequeue
queue = []
queue.pop(0)

# ‚úÖ GOOD - O(1) per dequeue
from collections import deque
queue = deque()
queue.popleft()
\`\`\`

‚ùå **Mistake 2:** Forgetting to track level size
\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå BAD - can't separate levels
while queue:
    node = queue.popleft()
    # Process and add children

# ‚úÖ GOOD - process level by level
while queue:
    level_size = len(queue)  # Capture current level
    for _ in range(level_size):
        node = queue.popleft()
        # Process and add children
\`\`\`

‚ùå **Mistake 3:** Not handling empty queue
\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå BAD - may raise exception
item = queue.popleft()

# ‚úÖ GOOD - check first
if queue:
    item = queue.popleft()
\`\`\`

‚ùå **Mistake 4:** Confusing queue with stack
\`\`\`python
# ‚ùå BAD - this is a stack (LIFO)
queue.append(item)
queue.pop()  # Removes last item

# ‚úÖ GOOD - this is a queue (FIFO)
queue.append(item)
queue.popleft()  # Removes first item
\`\`\`

## Complexity Analysis Tips

**BFS/Level-Order:**
- Time: O(n) where n is number of nodes
- Space: O(w) where w is maximum width
- "w can be O(n) for wide trees"

**Sliding Window with Deque:**
- Time: O(n) - each element added/removed once
- Space: O(k) - deque size bounded by window

**Queue Implementation:**
- Time: O(1) for all operations (with deque)
- Space: O(n) for n elements

                        'To check if the queue is empty',
                        'To know how many nodes are in the current level',
                        'To calculate total nodes in tree',

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation:
                        'Capturing len(queue) at the start tells us exactly how many nodes are in the current level, allowing us to process them separately from the next level.',
