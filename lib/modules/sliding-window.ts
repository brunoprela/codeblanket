      title: 'Introduction to Sliding Window',
      content: `The **sliding window** technique is an optimization pattern that transforms nested loops (O(N¬≤) or O(N*K)) into single-pass algorithms (O(N)). It's used to solve problems involving **contiguous sequences** in arrays or strings.

**Core Concept:**
Instead of recalculating results from scratch for each subarray, we maintain a "window" that slides through the data, incrementally updating our result by:
1. **Adding** new elements as the window expands/moves right
2. **Removing** old elements as the window contracts/moves left

**Real-World Analogies:**
- **Netflix viewing window**: As you scroll, new thumbnails appear on the right while old ones disappear on the left
- **Train window view**: The scenery changes continuously as the train moves
- **Reading comprehension**: Your attention spans a few sentences at a time, sliding as you read

**When to Use Sliding Window:**
- Finding subarrays/substrings with specific properties
- Problems involving **"contiguous"** or **"consecutive"** elements
- Keywords: "longest", "shortest", "maximum", "minimum" with constraints
- Optimizing from O(N¬≤) to O(N)

**Two Main Types:**

**1. Fixed-Size Window**
- Window size is constant (k elements)
- Always move right pointer, adjust left to maintain size
- Example: Maximum sum of k consecutive elements

**2. Variable-Size Window**
- Window size changes based on conditions
- Expand window when condition not met
- Shrink window when condition met
- Example: Longest substring without repeating characters`,

          question:
            'Explain the core concept of the sliding window technique. Why is it called a "window" and what makes it "slide"?',
          sampleAnswer:
            'The sliding window technique uses two pointers to define a contiguous subarray or substring - that is the "window". We start with both pointers at the beginning, then expand the window by moving the right pointer to include more elements. When certain conditions are met, we shrink the window by moving the left pointer. This creates a sliding motion - the window slides across the array or string. It is powerful because instead of checking all possible subarrays O(n¬≤), we maintain one window and adjust it as we go in O(n) time. The key is that we process each element at most twice - once when entering the window, once when leaving.',

          sampleAnswer:
            'Fixed-size windows have a predetermined size k - like max sum of k consecutive elements. I expand until reaching size k, then slide by adding right and removing left simultaneously. This is straightforward and great when the problem specifies exact window size. Variable-size windows adjust based on conditions - like longest substring without repeating characters. I expand right to include elements while condition holds, then shrink left when condition breaks. This is more complex but handles optimization problems where we seek maximum or minimum window satisfying constraints. Fixed-size: problem gives exact size.

**Problem:** Find maximum sum of k consecutive elements.

**Visualization:**
\`\`\`
Array: [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3

**Naive O(N*K):**

    max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

**Optimized O(N) with Sliding Window:**
\`\`\`python
# Initial window
window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
max_sum = window_sum

# Slide the window
for i in range(k, len(arr)):

    window_sum -= arr[i - k]  # Remove old element
    max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
\`\`\`

**Pattern 2: Variable-Size Window (Longest/Maximum)**

**Problem:** Longest substring without repeating characters.

**Visualization:**
\`\`\`
String: "abcabcbb"

Step 1: "a"       ‚Üí valid, expand. Longest = 1
Step 2: "ab"      ‚Üí valid, expand. Longest = 2
Step 3: "abc"     ‚Üí valid, expand. Longest = 3
Step 4: "abca"    ‚Üí invalid ('a' repeats), shrink
        "bca"     ‚Üí valid, expand. Longest = 3
Step 5: "bcab"    ‚Üí invalid ('b' repeats), shrink
        "cab"     ‚Üí valid, expand. Longest = 3
...

**Template:**
\`\`\`python

for right in range(len(arr)):
    # Add arr[right] to window
    window_data[arr[right]] = window_data.get(arr[right], 0) + 1

**Pattern 3: Variable-Size Window (Shortest/Minimum)**

**Problem:** Minimum window substring containing all characters.

**Visualization:**

String: "ADOBECODEBANC", Target: "ABC"

Expand until valid:

Shrink while still valid:

**Pattern 4: Sliding Window with Auxiliary Data Structure**

Use hash maps, sets, or counters to track window state:

**Hash Map (Frequency Count):**
\`\`\`python
from collections import defaultdict

window = defaultdict(int)
for char in s[left:right+1]:
    window[char] += 1
\`\`\`

**Set (Unique Elements):**
\`\`\`python
window = set()
for i in range(left, right + 1):
    window.add(arr[i])
\`\`\`

**Counter (Efficient Frequency):**
\`\`\`python
from collections import Counter

window = Counter(s[left:right+1])
\`\`\``,

      content: `**Sliding Window Complexity:**

**Time Complexity:**
- **Fixed-size window**: O(N) where N is array length
  - Initial window: O(K) to calculate first sum
  - Sliding: O(N - K) windows, O(1) per window
  - Total: O(K + N - K) = O(N)

- **Variable-size window**: O(N)
  - Right pointer moves N times: O(N)
  - Left pointer moves at most N times: O(N)
  - Total: O(N + N) = O(N)
  - **Key insight**: Each element is visited at most twice (once by right, once by left)

**Space Complexity:**
- **Without auxiliary structure**: O(1)
  - Only variables (pointers, sums, counters)

- **With hash map/set**: O(K)
  - K = size of window or character set
  - Example: At most 26 characters for lowercase English letters ‚Üí O(26) = O(1)
  - Example: Window of size K ‚Üí O(K)

**Comparison with Brute Force:**

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Brute Force | O(N¬≤) or O(N*K) | O(1) | Check every subarray |
| Sliding Window | O(N) | O(1) to O(K) | Optimal for contiguous problems |

**Example: Maximum Sum of Size K**
- Brute Force: O(N*K) - recalculate sum for each window
- Sliding Window: O(N) - reuse previous sum, add/remove one element

**Example: Longest Substring Without Repeating**
- Brute Force: O(N¬≥) - check all substrings for duplicates
- Sliding Window: O(N) - single pass with hash set

**Why O(N) for Variable Window?**
\`\`\`python
left = 0
for right in range(len(arr)):  # N iterations
    # ... add arr[right]
    
    while condition:  # How many times does this run?
        # ... remove arr[left]
        left += 1
\`\`\`

**Key Insight:** Although there's a nested while loop, left can only move from 0 to N-1 throughout the entire algorithm. So:
- Outer loop: N iterations
- Inner loop: N iterations TOTAL (not per outer iteration)
- **Total: O(N + N) = O(N)**`,

          question:
            'Explain why sliding window is O(n) even though there is a nested loop. How does amortized analysis apply here?',
          sampleAnswer:
            'Sliding window looks like O(n¬≤) with nested loops - outer loop moves right pointer n times, inner loop moves left pointer. But amortized analysis shows it is O(n). The key insight: left pointer moves at most n times total across the entire algorithm, not n times per right pointer iteration. Each element enters the window once (right pointer) and leaves at most once (left pointer), giving 2n operations total. So outer loop contributes O(n), inner loop across all iterations contributes O(n), total is O(2n) = O(n). The inner loop iterations are amortized - distributed across all outer iterations, not concentrated.',

            'Processing right pointer first means adding the element to the window before checking if conditions break. This is correct because we want to include the element, then determine if we need to shrink. If I check conditions before processing right, I am checking the window without the new element, which is the previous window state. For example, in longest substring without repeating, if I check for duplicate before adding current character, I miss that current character might be the duplicate.

Use a deque to track the maximum in each window efficiently:

\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

def sliding_window_maximum(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Find maximum in each window of size k.
    Time: O(N), Space: O(K)
    """
    result = []
    dq = deque()  # Store indices of useful elements
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Remove indices outside current window
        while dq and dq[0] < i - k + 1:
            dq.popleft()
        
        # Remove smaller elements (they'll never be max)
        while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < nums[i]:
            dq.pop()
        
        dq.append(i)
        
        # Add to result once window is full
        if i >= k - 1:
            result.append(nums[dq[0]])  # Front is the maximum

**Why this works:**
- Deque maintains indices in decreasing order of values
- Front always has the maximum
- Remove elements that can't be maximum (smaller + earlier)

Monotonic deque solves this by maintaining indices in decreasing order of their values. When a new element enters, we remove elements from the back that are smaller than it (they can never be maximum while the new element is in window). When elements leave the window, we remove from front if their index is outside window. The front always has the maximum for current window. This gives O(n) total time because each element is added and removed from deque at most once. Deque enables both ends operations in O(1).',

**Use Sliding Window when you see:**
- "Contiguous" subarray/substring
- "Consecutive" elements
- "Window" explicitly mentioned
- "Longest"/"Shortest"/"Maximum"/"Minimum" with constraints
- "At most K" or "At least K" distinct/same elements
- Array or string traversal problems
- Can optimize from O(N¬≤) to O(N)

---

**Problem-Solving Steps:**

**Step 1: Identify Window Type**
- **Fixed size?** ‚Üí Use Template 1 (add right, remove left)
- **Variable size?** ‚Üí Use Template 2 or 3 (adjust left based on condition)

**Step 2: Determine Objective**
- **Maximum/Longest?** ‚Üí Shrink when invalid, update outside while loop
- **Minimum/Shortest?** ‚Üí Shrink while valid, update inside while loop
- **Count/Existence?** ‚Üí Check condition at each step

**Step 3: Choose Data Structure**
- **Need frequencies?** ‚Üí Hash map or Counter
- **Need uniqueness?** ‚Üí Set
- **Need order/maximum?** ‚Üí Deque (monotonic queue)
- **Simple sum/count?** ‚Üí Variables only

**Step 4: Define Validity Condition**
What makes a window valid or invalid?
- "No repeating characters" ‚Üí Set size equals window size
- "At most K distinct" ‚Üí len(freq_map) <= K
- "Sum equals target" ‚Üí current_sum == target
- "Contains all of T" ‚Üí All chars in T are in window with sufficient count

**Step 5: Handle Edge Cases**
- Empty input
- K > length of array
- All elements same
- Single element array

---

**Interview Communication:**

1. **Identify pattern:** "This is a sliding window problem because we're looking for contiguous elements."

2. **Choose approach:** "I'll use a variable-size window with a hash set to track distinct characters."

3. **Explain invariant:** "The window will always contain at most K distinct characters."

4. **Walk through example:**
   \`\`\`
   s = "eceba", k = 2
   "e"     ‚Üí 1 distinct, valid
   "ec"    ‚Üí 2 distinct, valid, length = 2
   "ece"   ‚Üí 2 distinct, valid, length = 3 ‚Üê max
   "eceb"  ‚Üí 3 distinct, invalid ‚Üí shrink to "ceb"
   \`\`\`

5. **Discuss complexity:** "Time O(N) since each element is visited at most twice. Space O(K) for the hash map."

---

**Common Follow-ups:**

**Q: Can you solve it with constant space?**
- If character set is limited (e.g., 26 letters), use array instead of hash map: O(1) space

**Q: What if we need to track the actual substring/subarray?**
- Store indices: \`result = (left, right)\`
- Return: \`s[result[0]:result[1]+1]\`

**Q: How would you modify this for "at least K"?**
- Reverse the condition: shrink while count >= K

**Q: Can this be parallelized?**
- Sliding window is inherently sequential, but can divide array into chunks for approximate solutions

---

   - Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
   - Maximum Average Subarray

2. **Variable Window - Maximum (Day 3-4):**

            'First, I identify: "This is a longest substring problem with constraints, so I am thinking sliding window". Then I explain window type: "Variable-size window - I will expand right to include characters and shrink left when constraints break". I describe the state: "I will track character frequency using a hash map". Then the algorithm: "Expand right each iteration, update frequency. When I have duplicates, shrink left until removing the duplicate. Track maximum window size." I code while explaining each part. After coding, I trace an example: "For \'abcabcbb\', right moves to \'abc\' len 3, hits duplicate \'a\'...". Finally complexity: "O(n) time as each element enters and leaves once, O(k) space for hash map where k is alphabet size." Communication throughout is key.',

          sampleAnswer:
            'First mistake: off-by-one in window size calculation - use right - left + 1, not right - left. I verify with simple case: if left equals right, size is 1. Second: processing order - must add arr[right] before checking conditions, or we check old window. Third: update answer placement - outside while for maximum, inside while for minimum. I remember: shrink invalid for max, shrink valid for min. Fourth: forgetting to update state when moving left - must remove arr[left] from tracking. Fifth: manually incrementing right in for loop - let the for loop handle it. Sixth: not initializing properly - hash map, variables. I avoid these by using templates and testing edge cases early.',
