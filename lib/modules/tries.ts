      content: `A **Trie** (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used to store strings efficiently. Also called a **prefix tree** or **digital tree**, it's particularly useful for string searches and prefix matching.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Each node represents a single character
- Root node is empty
- Path from root to node = string prefix
- Leaf nodes (or marked nodes) = complete words
- Children typically stored in array or hash map

**Trie Structure:**

\`\`\`
Example: Insert "cat", "car", "dog"

        (root)
       /      \\
      c        d
      |        |
      a        o
     / \\       |
    t   r      g
   (*)  (*)   (*)

(*) = end of word marker
\`\`\`

**Why Use Tries?**

**Advantages:**
- **Fast prefix searches**: O(m) where m = string length
- **Autocomplete**: Find all words with prefix
- **Spell checking**: Fast dictionary lookups
- **Space efficient**: Shared prefixes (e.g., "cat", "car" share "ca")
- **No hash collisions**: Unlike hash tables

**Disadvantages:**
- **Space overhead**: Each node needs storage for all possible children
- **Cache locality**: Tree structure less cache-friendly than arrays
- **Memory**: Can use more memory than hash tables for sparse data

---

**Common Use Cases:**

1. **Autocomplete / Type-ahead**
   - Google search suggestions
   - IDE code completion

2. **Spell Checker**
   - Dictionary lookup
   - Suggest corrections

3. **IP Routing**
   - Longest prefix matching
   - Network routing tables

4. **Phone Directory**
   - Search by name prefix
   - T9 predictive text

5. **Word Games**
   - Boggle solver
   - Scrabble word validation`,

            'Explain what a Trie is and how it differs from other tree structures. What makes it special for string operations?',
          sampleAnswer:
            'A Trie (prefix tree) is a tree where each node represents a character and paths from root to nodes spell words. Unlike binary trees, each node can have up to 26 children (for lowercase English). Special for strings because it stores common prefixes once - if you have "cat" and "car", they share "ca". Each edge represents adding one character. Searching for word takes O(L) where L is word length, independent of how many words stored. Binary search tree would take O(L log N) where N is number of words. Trie trades space for time: uses more memory (26 pointers per node even if unused) but provides fast prefix operations. Perfect for autocomplete, spell check, IP routing.',

Second insert reuses Câ†’A, creates R branch at A, marks R as end. The A node now has two children: T and R. This is key efficiency: shared prefix "ca" stored once, not duplicated.

IP routing: store IP prefixes, match longest prefix efficiently. Word break: check if segments are valid words. Phone T9: map number sequences to possible words.

      content: `**Basic Trie Node Structure:**

\`\`\`python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}  # or [None] * 26 for lowercase letters
        self.is_end_of_word = False
\`\`\`

**Two Storage Approaches:**

**1. Hash Map (Dictionary)**
\`\`\`python
children = {}  # Flexible, any character
\`\`\`
**Pros**: Handles any character set, space efficient for sparse data
**Cons**: Slightly slower lookup (O(1) average vs O(1) guaranteed)

**2. Fixed Array**
\`\`\`python
children = [None] * 26  # Only lowercase a-z
\`\`\`
**Pros**: O(1) guaranteed lookup, cache-friendly
**Cons**: Wastes space if sparse, limited to fixed alphabet

**Operation Complexities:**

| Operation | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Insert | O(m) | O(m) |
| Search | O(m) | O(1) |
| Prefix Search | O(m) | O(1) |
| Delete | O(m) | O(1) |

**Memory Analysis:**

For **n** words with average length **m**:
- **Worst case**: O(ALPHABET_SIZE * m * n)
  - Each character has array of size 26
- **Best case**: O(m * n)
  - All words share common prefix

      title: 'Common Trie Patterns',
      content: `**Pattern 1: Standard Dictionary**

Most basic use: Insert words and search.

\`\`\`python
trie = Trie()
trie.insert("apple")
trie.insert("app")

trie.search("app")      # True
trie.search("appl")     # False
trie.starts_with("app") # True
\`\`\`

---

**Pattern 2: Autocomplete / Type-ahead**

Find all words with given prefix.

\`\`\`python
def autocomplete(trie, prefix):
    # Find node at end of prefix
    node = trie._search_prefix(prefix)
    if not node:
        return []
    
    # DFS to collect all words from here
    words = []
    
    def dfs(node, path):
        if node.is_end_of_word:
            words.append(prefix + path)
        for char, child in node.children.items():
            dfs(child, path + char)
    
    dfs(node, "")
    return words
\`\`\`

---

**Pattern 3: Word Search with Wildcards**

Support '.' as wildcard (matches any character).

\`\`\`python
def search_with_wildcard(self, word: str) -> bool:
    def dfs(node, i):
        if i == len(word):
            return node.is_end_of_word
        
        char = word[i]
        
        if char == '.':
            # Try all possible children
            for child in node.children.values():
                if dfs(child, i + 1):
                    return True
            return False
        else:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            return dfs(node.children[char], i + 1)
    
    return dfs(self.root, 0)
\`\`\`

---

**Pattern 4: Word Break Problem**

Check if string can be segmented into dictionary words.

\`\`\`python
def word_break(s: str, wordDict: list) -> bool:
    # Build trie from dictionary
    trie = Trie()
    for word in wordDict:
        trie.insert(word)
    
    # DP with trie
    n = len(s)
    dp = [False] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = True
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        node = trie.root
        for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
            if not dp[j]:
                continue
            
            char = s[j]
            if char not in node.children:
                break
            
            node = node.children[char]
            if node.is_end_of_word:
                dp[i] = True
                break
    
    return dp[n]
\`\`\`

---

**Pattern 5: Longest Common Prefix**

Find longest prefix shared by all strings.

\`\`\`python
def longest_common_prefix(strs: list) -> str:
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    trie = Trie()
    for s in strs:
        trie.insert(s)
    
    # Traverse until branch or end
    prefix = []
    node = trie.root
    
    while len(node.children) == 1 and not node.is_end_of_word:
        char = list(node.children.keys())[0]
        prefix.append(char)
        node = node.children[char]
    
    return "".join(prefix)
\`\`\`

---

**Pattern 6: Count Prefixes**

Count how many words start with each prefix.

\`\`\`python
class TrieNodeWithCount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.count = 0  # Number of words passing through
        self.is_end = False

def count_prefixes(words: list, prefixes: list) -> list:
    trie = Trie()
    
    # Insert with counts
    for word in words:
        node = trie.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNodeWithCount()
            node = node.children[char]
            node.count += 1
        node.is_end = True
    
    # Query counts
    result = []
    for prefix in prefixes:
        node = trie._search_prefix(prefix)
        result.append(node.count if node else 0)
    
    return result

If we hit end-of-word marker, s[j..i] is valid word, so dp[i] = dp[i] or dp[j]. Without Trie, checking if s[j..i] is valid word takes O(word_count Ã— word_length).

 (*)                 

Saves space by storing "ar" instead of "a" -> "r"

**Technique 2: Suffix Trie**

Build trie of all suffixes for pattern matching.

\`\`\`python
def build_suffix_trie(text: str):
    trie = Trie()
    for i in range(len(text)):
        trie.insert(text[i:])
    return trie

# Check if pattern exists in text
def contains_pattern(text, pattern):
    suffix_trie = build_suffix_trie(text)
    return suffix_trie.starts_with(pattern)

**Technique 3: Ternary Search Tree**

Space-efficient alternative to trie.

Each node has 3 children: less, equal, greater.

\`\`\`python
class TSTNode:
    def __init__(self, char):
        self.char = char
        self.left = None   # char < node.char
        self.mid = None    # char == node.char (next)
        self.right = None  # char > node.char
        self.is_end = False
\`\`\`

**Advantages:**
- Uses less memory than standard trie
- Faster than hash table for small alphabets
- Supports ordered operations

---

**Technique 4: Persistent Trie**

Maintain multiple versions without copying entire structure.

**Use case**: Version control, undo/redo operations

---

Where:

- **n** = number of strings stored

**Space Complexity:**

**Worst Case**: O(ALPHABET_SIZE * m * n)
- Each of n words, length m
- Each character needs array of size ALPHABET_SIZE

**Best Case**: O(m * n)
- All words share maximum common prefix

**Typical Case**: Depends on:
- Alphabet size (26 for lowercase, 256 for ASCII)
- Number of shared prefixes
- Storage method (array vs hash map)

**Space Optimization Techniques:**

**1. Use Hash Map Instead of Array**
\`\`\`python
children = {}  # Only store existing children
# vs
children = [None] * 26  # Allocate all 26 slots

**2. Compressed Trie**
Merge single-child chains into one node.

**3. Bit-packed Storage**
Use bit manipulation for compact storage.

**4. Reference Counting**
Share nodes between tries where possible.

- Multiple string operations?
- Prefix-related queries?
- Dictionary lookups?

**Step 2: Choose Structure (2 min)**
- Standard trie (hash map)?
- Array-based (fixed alphabet)?
- Need counts? Modify node

**Step 3: Define Node (3 min)**
\`\`\`python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end = False
        # Add other fields if needed:
        # self.count = 0
        # self.word = None
\`\`\`

**Step 4: Implement Operations (10 min)**
- Insert: Always needed
- Search: Exact or prefix?
- Delete: Rarely needed
- Custom: Problem-specific

**Step 5: Test Edge Cases (3 min)**
- Empty string
- Single character
- No matching prefix
- All strings identical

**Interview Communication:**

**Example: Implement Trie**

*Interviewer: Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith.*

**You:**

1. **Clarify:**
   - "Should I handle only lowercase letters?"
   - "Do we need to support deletion?"
   - "Any constraints on number of words or length?"

2. **Explain:**
   - "I'll use a hash map for children - flexible and space efficient."
   - "Each node needs a flag to mark end of word."
   - "Root node will be empty."

3. **Structure:**
   \`\`\`python
   class TrieNode:
       def __init__(self):
           self.children = {}  # char -> TrieNode
           self.is_end = False
   \`\`\`

4. **Operations:**
   - "Insert: Traverse/create path, mark end."
   - "Search: Traverse path, check is_end."
   - "StartsWith: Just traverse path."

5. **Complexity:**
   - "All operations are O(m) time where m is string length."
   - "Space is O(n * m * ALPHABET) worst case."

---

**Common Mistakes:**

**1. Forgetting is_end Flag**
\`\`\`python
# Wrong: Just having node doesn't mean word exists
if node:
    return True

# Right: Check if it's marked as end
if node and node.is_end:
    return True
\`\`\`

**2. Not Handling Empty String**
Always consider edge case of empty input.

**3. Memory Leak in Delete**
Must carefully clean up unused nodes.

**4. Inefficient Prefix Collection**
Use DFS, not repeated searches.

          question:
            'How do you recognize that a problem needs a Trie? What keywords or patterns signal this?',
          sampleAnswer:
            'Several signals indicate Trie. Explicit: "prefix", "autocomplete", "dictionary", "word search", "spell check". Implicit: multiple words need efficient lookup, need to find all words with prefix, matching patterns in strings. Problem types: implement dictionary with prefix query, word break, design search autocomplete, replace words, stream of characters. If problem involves many words and prefix operations, Trie is likely. For example, "design search autocomplete system" screams Trie. "Check if word exists in dictionary" could be hash table unless prefix operations mentioned. Ask yourself: do I need prefix matching? Do multiple words share prefixes? Is dictionary static or changing? Trie excels at: changing dictionary with prefix queries.',

          sampleAnswer:
            'First, recognize Trie from keywords (prefix, autocomplete). Second, clarify: character set (lowercase only?), will words be deleted, max word length, number of words. Third, explain approach: build Trie, insert all words, for queries traverse Trie. Fourth, state complexity: insert O(m) per word, search O(m), space O(ALPHABET Ã— m Ã— n) worst case, better with shared prefixes. Fifth, discuss implementation: use dict for children (flexible) vs array (faster), is_end_of_word flag essential. Sixth, draw small example: insert "cat", "car", show shared prefix. Seventh, code clearly with TrieNode class and Trie class. Test with example. Finally, optimize if needed: compressed Trie for space, add counts for frequency queries.',

          sampleAnswer:
            'First: forgetting is_end_of_word flag, causing failure when words are prefixes of others ("car" and "carpet"). Second: using fixed array without checking char is in range (crashes on non-lowercase). Third: not handling empty string edge case. Fourth: in autocomplete, forgetting to add prefix to collected words (returning "r" instead of "car" for prefix "ca"). Fifth: delete implementation breaking other words (removing shared nodes). Sixth: thinking Trie needed when Hash Table sufficient (if no prefix operations). My strategy: always include is_end_of_word, validate character range if using array, test with prefix words ("a", "ab", "abc"), draw tree to visualize structure, verify sharing works correctly.',
          keyPoints: [
            'Forgetting is_end_of_word (fails on prefix words)',
