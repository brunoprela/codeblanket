            content: `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects that contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

**Why OOP Matters:**
- **Encapsulation:** Bundle data and methods that operate on that data
- **Inheritance:** Reuse code through parent-child class relationships
- **Polymorphism:** Use objects of different types through a common interface
- **Abstraction:** Hide complex implementation details

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Game Development:** Player, Enemy, Weapon classes
- **Web Frameworks:** Django models, Flask views
- **Data Processing:** Custom data structures and transformations
- **API Clients:** Service classes with methods for different endpoints

**Key Insight:**
OOP helps organize complex systems by modeling real-world entities and their relationships, making code more maintainable and easier to reason about.`,

                        'The four pillars are: (1) Encapsulation‚Äîbundling data and methods together, hiding internal details. (2) Abstraction‚Äîexposing only essential features, hiding complexity. (3) Inheritance‚Äîcreating new classes from existing ones, promoting code reuse. (4) Polymorphism‚Äîusing objects of different types through a common interface. They work together: encapsulation hides how something works, abstraction defines what it does, inheritance lets you extend functionality, and polymorphism lets you use different implementations interchangeably. For example, a Car class encapsulates engine details, abstracts a drive() method, inherits from Vehicle, and can be used polymorphically with Truck.',
