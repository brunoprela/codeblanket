      content: `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects that contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

**Why OOP Matters:**
- **Encapsulation:** Bundle data and methods that operate on that data
- **Inheritance:** Reuse code through parent-child class relationships
- **Polymorphism:** Use objects of different types through a common interface
- **Abstraction:** Hide complex implementation details

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Game Development:** Player, Enemy, Weapon classes
- **Web Frameworks:** Django models, Flask views
- **Data Processing:** Custom data structures and transformations
- **API Clients:** Service classes with methods for different endpoints

**Key Insight:**
OOP helps organize complex systems by modeling real-world entities and their relationships, making code more maintainable and easier to reason about.`,

            'Explain the four pillars of OOP and how they work together.',
          sampleAnswer:
            'The four pillars are: (1) Encapsulation‚Äîbundling data and methods together, hiding internal details. (2) Abstraction‚Äîexposing only essential features, hiding complexity. (3) Inheritance‚Äîcreating new classes from existing ones, promoting code reuse. (4) Polymorphism‚Äîusing objects of different types through a common interface. They work together: encapsulation hides how something works, abstraction defines what it does, inheritance lets you extend functionality, and polymorphism lets you use different implementations interchangeably. For example, a Car class encapsulates engine details, abstracts a drive() method, inherits from Vehicle, and can be used polymorphically with Truck.',

          sampleAnswer:
            'Use composition when you have a "has-a" relationship rather than "is-a". Composition is more flexible and avoids fragile base class problems. For example, bad inheritance: class Car(Engine, Transmission, Stereo)‚Äîa car "is-a" engine? No. Good composition: class Car has self.engine, self.transmission, self.stereo. Composition lets you: (1) change implementations at runtime, (2) avoid deep inheritance hierarchies, (3) have better encapsulation. Use inheritance for true "is-a" relationships like ElectricCar(Car) or Dog(Animal), but prefer composition for behavior delegation.',

\`\`\`python
class Dog:
    # Class attribute (shared by all instances)
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes (unique to each instance)

buddy = Dog("Buddy", 5)
miles = Dog("Miles", 4)

print(buddy.bark())  # "Buddy says woof!"
print(miles)  # "Miles is 4 years old"

**Instance vs Class Attributes:**
\`\`\`python
class Employee:
    company = "TechCorp"  # Class attribute
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute

emp1 = Employee("Alice")
emp2 = Employee("Bob")

# Class attribute shared
print(emp1.company)  # "TechCorp"
print(emp2.company)  # "TechCorp"

# Change class attribute affects all
Employee.company = "NewCorp"
print(emp1.company)  # "NewCorp"

**Special Methods (Dunder Methods):**
\`\`\`python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __str__(self):

p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(3, 4)
print(p1 + p2)  # Point(4, 6)
print(p1 == p2)  # False
\`\`\`

**Properties:**
\`\`\`python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius
    
    @property
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius

            'MRO is the order Python searches for methods in the inheritance hierarchy. It matters because in multiple inheritance, a method might exist in multiple parent classes. Python uses C3 linearization algorithm to create a consistent order. You can see it with ClassName.mro(). For example, if D inherits from B and C, which both inherit from A, the MRO is D -> B -> C -> A -> object. Python searches left to right, depth-first, but ensures each class appears only once and parents appear after their children. This prevents the diamond problem and ensures super() works correctly.',

          sampleAnswer:
            "Use ABCs to define interfaces that subclasses MUST implement. They prevent instantiation of incomplete classes and enforce a contract. Use when: 1) you have a family of related classes that should share an interface, 2) you want to ensure subclasses implement certain methods, 3) you're building a framework or library. For example, Shape ABC requires area() and perimeter() methods‚Äîyou can't create a Shape, only concrete subclasses like Circle or Rectangle that implement these methods. This catches errors at instantiation time rather than runtime. ABCs document intent and enable isinstance() checks for interface compliance.",

          hint: 'Consider cooperative multiple inheritance and method chaining.',
          sampleAnswer:
            'super() follows the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to call the next method in the chain, not just the immediate parent. This enables cooperative multiple inheritance where each class calls super() to ensure all parents get called in the correct order. Without super(), in multiple inheritance you might call parent methods explicitly (Parent1.__init__(self), Parent2.__init__(self)), but this breaks if the hierarchy changes or causes methods to be called multiple times. super() is especially critical for __init__‚Äîit ensures proper initialization order. Always use super() instead of calling parent class methods directly for maintainability and correctness.',
