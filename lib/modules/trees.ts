      content: `A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with one node designated as the **root**. Trees are acyclic (no cycles) and connected (path exists between any two nodes).

**Key Terminology:**

- **Root**: Top node with no parent
- **Parent**: Node with children
- **Child**: Node with a parent
- **Leaf**: Node with no children
- **Siblings**: Nodes with the same parent
- **Ancestor**: Node on the path from root to current node
- **Descendant**: Node in the subtree of current node
- **Height**: Length of longest path from node to a leaf
- **Depth/Level**: Length of path from root to node
- **Subtree**: Tree rooted at any node

**Binary Tree:**
Each node has at most 2 children (left and right).

**5. Balanced Tree**
Height difference between left and right subtrees â‰¤ 1 for all nodes.

**Python Implementation:**
\`\`\`python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

# Create a tree:
#     1
#    / \\
#   2   3
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
\`\`\`

**When to Use Trees:**
- Hierarchical relationships (file systems, org charts)
- Fast search, insert, delete (BST: O(log N) average)
- Priority queues (heaps)
- Expression parsing
- Decision-making (decision trees)`,

            'Explain why trees are hierarchical and what makes them different from linear structures like arrays or linked lists.',
          sampleAnswer:
            'Trees are hierarchical because each node can have multiple children, creating parent-child relationships in levels. A node at level k has children at level k+1, forming a tree-like branching structure. This is fundamentally different from linear structures like arrays or linked lists where elements have at most one predecessor and one successor, forming a single chain. Trees enable representing hierarchical relationships like file systems (directories contain files and subdirectories), organization charts (managers have employees), or DOM structure (elements contain child elements). The hierarchy enables divide-and-conquer algorithms - we can recursively solve for subtrees independently.',

          sampleAnswer:
            'Binary trees limit each node to at most two children - left and right. This constraint gives structure and enables specific algorithms. Binary Search Trees use this for efficient O(log n) search by maintaining left < parent < right ordering. General trees allow unlimited children per node, more flexible but harder to balance and search efficiently. Binary trees are preferred when you need fast search (BST), when data naturally has binary decisions (decision trees), or when implementing heaps and priority queues. The two-child limit makes many operations simpler to implement and analyze. For data with many children per node like file systems, general trees are better.',

            'A Binary Search Tree maintains the property: for every node, all left subtree values are less than node value, and all right subtree values are greater. This ordering enables binary search. To search for a value, I compare with root: if target is less, search left; if greater, search right; if equal, found. Each comparison eliminates half the remaining tree. In a balanced BST with n nodes, height is log n. Since we make one comparison per level, search is O(log n). For example, searching in a balanced tree of 1000 nodes takes at most 10 comparisons (2^10 = 1024). This is why BSTs are powerful - same logarithmic efficiency as binary search on arrays, but with fast insertion and deletion.',

      title: 'Tree Traversals',
      content: `Tree traversals visit each node exactly once in a specific order. There are two main categories: **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.

**Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversals:**

Given tree:
\`\`\`
      1
     / \\
    2   3
   / \\
  4   5
\`\`\`

**1. Preorder (Root â†’ Left â†’ Right)**
Visit order: **1**, 2, 4, 5, 3
- Process root first
- Useful for: Copying tree, prefix expressions
\`\`\`python
def preorder(root):
    if not root:
        return
    print(root.val)        # Process root
    preorder(root.left)    # Left subtree
    preorder(root.right)   # Right subtree
\`\`\`

**2. Inorder (Left â†’ Root â†’ Right)**
Visit order: 4, 2, 5, **1**, 3
- Process root between subtrees
- **Gives sorted order for BST!**
- Useful for: BST validation, sorted output
\`\`\`python
def inorder(root):
    if not root:
        return
    inorder(root.left)     # Left subtree
    print(root.val)        # Process root
    inorder(root.right)    # Right subtree
\`\`\`

**3. Postorder (Left â†’ Right â†’ Root)**
Visit order: 4, 5, 2, 3, **1**
- Process root last
- Useful for: Deleting tree, postfix expressions
\`\`\`python
def postorder(root):
    if not root:

    postorder(root.left)   # Left subtree
    postorder(root.right)  # Right subtree
    print(root.val)        # Process root

**Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Level Order:**

Visit nodes level by level, left to right.
Visit order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

\`\`\`python
from collections import deque

def level_order(root):
    if not root:
        return
    
    queue = deque([root])

        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)

**Iterative DFS (Using Stack):**

\`\`\`python
def preorder_iterative(root):
    if not root:
        return
    
    stack = [root]
    
    while stack:

        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
\`\`\`

**Inorder Iterative (More Complex):**
\`\`\`python
def inorder_iterative(root):
    stack = []
    curr = root
    
    while stack or curr:
        # Go to leftmost node
        while curr:

        print(curr.val)
        
        # Move to right subtree
        curr = curr.right

**Complexity:**
- **Time**: O(N) - visit each node once
- **Space**:
  - Recursive: O(H) for call stack
  - Iterative: O(H) for stack/queue
  - Where H = height (log N for balanced, N for skewed)`,

BFS is better for finding shortest path (level-order guarantees minimum depth), when solutions are likely near root, or for level-specific operations.

While stack not empty: pop node, process it, push right child then left child (right first so left is processed first). This matches recursion because recursion uses call stack implicitly - when we call on left subtree, the right subtree call is waiting on the call stack. Our explicit stack does the same: by pushing right first, it waits at bottom of stack while we process left. The stack stores pending work just like recursion stores pending function calls.

**Pattern 2: Binary Search Tree Operations**

Leverage BST property: left < root < right

**Search:**
\`\`\`python
def search_bst(root, target):
    if not root or root.val == target:
        return root
    
    if target < root.val:
        return search_bst(root.left, target)
    else:
        return search_bst(root.right, target)
\`\`\`

**Insert:**
\`\`\`python
def insert_bst(root, val):
    if not root:
        return TreeNode(val)
    
    if val < root.val:
        root.left = insert_bst(root.left, val)
    else:
        root.right = insert_bst(root.right, val)
    
    return root
\`\`\`

**Pattern 3: Path Problems**

Track path from root to target.

**Example: Path Sum**
\`\`\`python
def has_path_sum(root, target_sum):
    if not root:
        return False
    
    # Leaf node check
    if not root.left and not root.right:
        return root.val == target_sum
    
    # Recursively check subtrees
    remaining = target_sum - root.val
    return (has_path_sum(root.left, remaining) or
            has_path_sum(root.right, remaining))
\`\`\`

---

**Pattern 4: Level-by-Level Processing**

Use BFS for level-specific operations.

**Example: Right Side View**
\`\`\`python
def right_side_view(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        
        for i in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            # Last node in level
            if i == level_size - 1:
                result.append(node.val)
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
    
    return result
\`\`\`

**Pattern 5: Subtree Problems**

Check properties for entire subtrees.

**Example: Same Tree**
\`\`\`python
def is_same_tree(p, q):
    # Both null
    if not p and not q:
        return True
    
    # One null
    if not p or not q:
        return False
    
    # Values different
    if p.val != q.val:
        return False
    
    # Check subtrees
    return (is_same_tree(p.left, q.left) and
            is_same_tree(p.right, q.right))
\`\`\`

---

**Pattern 6: Bottom-Up vs Top-Down**

**Top-Down (Preorder):**
- Pass information down from parent to children
- Example: Depth tracking

\`\`\`python
def top_down(root, depth=0):
    if not root:
        return
    
    # Use depth information
    process(root, depth)
    
    # Pass down to children
    top_down(root.left, depth + 1)
    top_down(root.right, depth + 1)
\`\`\`

**Bottom-Up (Postorder):**
- Gather information from children to parent
- Example: Height calculation

\`\`\`python
def bottom_up(root):
    if not root:
        return 0
    
    # Get info from children
    left_result = bottom_up(root.left)
    right_result = bottom_up(root.right)
    
    # Compute and return result
    return 1 + max(left_result, right_result)

          sampleAnswer:
            'The recursive DFS pattern has three steps: base case (null check, return default), recurse on children (get results from left and right subtrees), compute current result (use children results and current node). This is powerful because it naturally divides the problem - solve for subtrees recursively, then combine their results. For example, tree height: base case returns 0 for null, recurse gets left and right heights, compute returns 1 + max(left, right). The pattern works for most tree problems: max depth, balanced check, path sum, etc. It leverages trees recursive structure - a tree is root plus two subtrees. Once you master this pattern, many tree problems become straightforward.',

          sampleAnswer:
            'The subtree pattern processes each node with context from ancestors. For BST validation, each node must be within a valid range: left subtree must be less than node, right subtree must be greater. I pass down min and max bounds: for left child, max becomes current node value (everything must be less). For right child, min becomes current node value (everything must be greater). At each node, I check if value is in valid range (min < value < max), then recurse with updated bounds. This ensures BST property for entire tree. Without bounds, just checking node > left and node < right is insufficient - you miss violations deeper in tree. The pattern: pass down ancestor context, check current node against context.',

**Binary Search Tree (Balanced):**
| Operation | Average | Worst (Skewed) |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Search | O(log N) | O(N) |
| Insert | O(log N) | O(N) |
| Delete | O(log N) | O(N) |
| Min/Max | O(log N) | O(N) |

**Traversal Complexities:**
| Traversal | Time | Space (Recursive) | Space (Iterative) |
|-----------|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Preorder | O(N) | O(H) | O(H) |
| Inorder | O(N) | O(H) | O(H) |
| Postorder | O(N) | O(H) | O(H) |
| Level Order | O(N) | O(W) | O(W) |

Where:
- N = number of nodes
- H = height (log N for balanced, N for skewed)
- W = maximum width (N/2 for complete trees)

**Common Problem Complexities:**

**Height/Depth:**
- Time: O(N) - visit all nodes
- Space: O(H) - recursion depth

**Diameter:**
- Time: O(N) - visit all nodes
- Space: O(H) - recursion stack

**Lowest Common Ancestor:**
- Time: O(N) - might visit all nodes
- Space: O(H) - recursion depth

**Path Sum:**
- Time: O(N) - might check all paths
- Space: O(H) - recursion + path storage

**Serialize/Deserialize:**
- Time: O(N) - process each node once
- Space: O(N) - store all nodes

**Balanced Tree Check:**
- Time: O(N) - visit each node once
- Space: O(H) - recursion depth

**Key Insights:**

**Space Complexity:**
- **Recursive DFS**: O(H) for call stack
- **Iterative DFS**: O(H) for explicit stack
- **BFS**: O(W) for queue (worst case N/2 for complete tree)

**Height Matters:**
- Balanced tree: H = O(log N)
- Skewed tree: H = O(N)
- Operations are H-dependent, so balance is crucial

**Complete Binary Tree:**
- Height: O(log N)
- Width: O(N/2) at deepest level
- Efficient for heaps and priority queues`,

For example, inserting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in order creates a right-skewed tree where searching for 5 requires checking all 5 nodes. Balance matters because it maintains the logarithmic efficiency that makes BSTs useful.

This works for many problems because most tree problems have recursive substructure - answer for tree depends on answers for subtrees. For max depth: base returns 0, recursive gets left and right depths, combine with 1 + max. For sum of nodes: base returns 0, recursive gets left and right sums, combine with node.val + left + right.

For level-order, we need level size because queue mixes nodes from current level with children added during processing. Without tracking size, we cannot tell when one level ends and next begins. The pattern: before processing level, save queue size (number of nodes at this level), process exactly that many nodes, adding their children. This ensures we process one complete level before starting next. For example, with queue [1,2,3], size is 3, we process exactly 3 nodes, adding their children to queue for next level.

**Use Tree algorithms when you see:**
- "Binary tree", "Binary search tree"
- "Root", "leaf", "parent", "child"
- "Traversal" (preorder, inorder, postorder, level-order)
- "Ancestor", "descendant", "subtree"
- "Depth", "height", "level"
- Hierarchical relationships
- "Path from root to leaf"

---

**Problem-Solving Steps:**

**Step 1: Clarify Tree Type**
- Binary tree or N-ary tree?
- Binary search tree (BST)?
- Balanced or unbalanced?
- Can there be duplicates?

**Step 2: Choose Traversal**
- **Need sorted order?** â†’ Inorder (for BST)
- **Need to process parents first?** â†’ Preorder (top-down)
- **Need to process children first?** â†’ Postorder (bottom-up)
- **Need level information?** â†’ BFS/Level-order

**Step 3: Recursive vs Iterative**
- **Recursive**: Cleaner, natural for trees
- **Iterative**: Better for very deep trees (avoid stack overflow)
- Most tree problems favor recursive solutions

**Step 4: Identify Pattern**
- Single node processing? â†’ Simple DFS
- Comparing subtrees? â†’ Recursive with left/right results
- Path problems? â†’ DFS with path tracking
- Level problems? â†’ BFS
- BST property? â†’ Binary search approach

**Step 5: Handle Edge Cases**
- Empty tree (root is None)
- Single node
- Skewed tree (all left or all right)
- Complete/perfect tree

---

**Interview Communication:**

**Example: Maximum Depth**

1. **Clarify:**
   - "Is this a binary tree or N-ary?"
   - "Can the tree be empty?"

2. **Explain approach:**
   - "I'll use recursive DFS."
   - "The depth of a node is 1 + max depth of its subtrees."
   - "Base case: null node has depth 0."

3. **Walk through example:**
   \`\`\`
       3
      / \\
     9  20
        / \\
       15  7
   
   max_depth(3):
     max_depth(9) = 1 (leaf)
     max_depth(20):
       max_depth(15) = 1
       max_depth(7) = 1
       return 1 + max(1,1) = 2
     return 1 + max(1,2) = 3
   \`\`\`

4. **Complexity:**
   - "Time: O(N) - visit each node once."
   - "Space: O(H) - recursion stack, where H is height."

5. **Mention alternatives:**
   - "Could also use BFS, counting levels."
   - "Would use O(W) space for queue."

---

**Common Follow-ups:**

**Q: Can you do it iteratively?**
- Show BFS or iterative DFS with explicit stack

**Q: What if the tree is very deep?**
- Discuss stack overflow risk
- Suggest iterative approach

**Q: Can you optimize space?**
- DFS is already O(H)
- For balanced tree, H = O(log N) - optimal

**Q: How would this work for BST?**
- Leverage BST property for pruning/optimization
