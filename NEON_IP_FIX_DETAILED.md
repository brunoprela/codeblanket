# Neon IP Block - Detailed Fix Guide

## The Error You're Seeing

```
"This connection is trying to access this endpoint from a blocked network."
```

This is **100% a Neon IP restriction issue**, even if "Allow public traffic" appears to be ON.

## Where to Look in Neon Console

### Location 1: Project Settings (Most Common)

1. Go to https://console.neon.tech
2. Select your `codeblanket` project
3. Click **"Settings"** in left sidebar
4. Scroll down to find **"IP Allow"** section

You should see one of these:

#### Option A: Toggle Switch
```
[ ] Enable IP allowlist
```
Make sure this is **UNCHECKED** (disabled)

#### Option B: IP Allowlist Field
```
IP Allowlist: [                    ]
              [+ Add IP Address     ]
```
If you see this, **leave it EMPTY** or add `0.0.0.0/0`

#### Option C: Radio Buttons
```
( ) Restrict access to only these IPs: [____]
(*) Allow all IP addresses
```
Select **"Allow all IP addresses"**

### Location 2: Branch-Specific Settings

Neon has **project-level** AND **branch-level** settings!

1. In Neon Console, click **"Branches"** in left sidebar
2. Find your `main` or `production` branch
3. Click on it
4. Look for **IP restrictions** or **Security** settings
5. Make sure IP restrictions are **OFF** at the branch level too

### Location 3: Database-Specific Settings

Some Neon accounts have database-level restrictions:

1. Click **"Databases"** in Neon Console
2. Click on `neondb`
3. Check for any IP or firewall settings
4. Disable them

## Screenshots to Help You

Look for settings that say:
- ‚úÖ "IP Allow" - Should be empty or disabled
- ‚úÖ "Protected branches" - Should NOT include your branch
- ‚úÖ "Firewall rules" - Should be empty or disabled
- ‚úÖ "Network access" - Should be "Public" or "Allow all"

## Alternative: Use Allowlist Bypass

If you CAN'T disable IP restrictions (company policy, etc.):

### Add These IPs to Allowlist:

#### For Development (Your Computer):
1. Go to https://whatismyipaddress.com
2. Copy your IP address
3. Add to Neon allowlist

#### For Production (Vercel):
**Problem**: Vercel uses dynamic IPs that change frequently.

**Solution**: Use `0.0.0.0/0` (allow all) or contact Neon support for Vercel integration.

## Test After Each Change

After making ANY change in Neon:

1. **Wait 30 seconds** (settings propagate)
2. **Go to**: https://your-app.vercel.app/debug
3. **Click** "üîå Test Database Connection"
4. **Look for**: `"success": true`

If still blocked, try the next location above.

## Nuclear Option: Create New Neon Project

If nothing works:

1. Create a brand new Neon project (fresh start)
2. When creating, **do NOT enable IP restrictions**
3. Copy the new DATABASE_URL
4. Run your schema.sql on the new database
5. Update Vercel environment variables
6. Redeploy

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Wrong Setting
Looking at "Allow traffic via public internet" (networking)
This is about **public vs private VPC**, NOT IP restrictions!

### ‚úÖ Correct Setting
Looking at "IP Allow" or "IP Allowlist" (security)
This controls which IP addresses can connect.

## Quick Visual Guide

In Neon Console, look for sections named:
- **"Security"** ‚Üí IP Allow
- **"Access Control"** ‚Üí IP Restrictions  
- **"Firewall"** ‚Üí Allowed IPs
- **"Protected Branches"** ‚Üí IP Settings

**NOT** these sections (wrong place):
- "Networking" ‚Üí VPC/Public Internet (this is about VPC vs public, not IPs)
- "Compute" ‚Üí Autoscaling (wrong section)
- "Storage" ‚Üí Data (wrong section)

## Contact Neon Support

If you still can't find it:

1. Go to https://neon.tech/docs/connect/connect-from-vercel
2. Or contact Neon support with this error message
3. Tell them: "Vercel deployment getting 'blocked network' error"

They'll point you to the exact setting!

## Temporary Workaround (Development Only)

For localhost development while you figure this out:

You can use the **Neon Proxy** (experimental):

```bash
npm install -g neon-cli
neon auth
neon connection-string --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

Then use that URL locally. But this doesn't solve production!

## Most Likely Solution

**There's probably a setting called "IP Allow" or "Allowed IPs" that has an empty allowlist**, which blocks everyone.

The fix: Either **disable that setting entirely** or **add `0.0.0.0/0`** to the allowlist.

---

**Keep looking for "IP Allow" or "IP Allowlist" in Settings!** That's where the block is configured.
