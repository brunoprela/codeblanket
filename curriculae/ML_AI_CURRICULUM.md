## Notes

- Each section should be 400-600 lines with theory, code, and examples
- All code must be executable and well-documented
- Include both "from scratch" implementations (educational) and library implementations (practical)
- Emphasize intuition before mathematics
- Real-world examples from finance, especially for Modules 8-15
- Discussion questions should connect theory to trading applications
- Progressive complexity: simple examples ‚Üí complex real-world scenarios
- Include common pitfalls and debugging strategies
- Link mathematical concepts to practical ML applications
- Trading-focused examples should include realistic constraints (transaction costs, slippage, risk management)
