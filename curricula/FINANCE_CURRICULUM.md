# Finance & Quantitative Engineering Curriculum - Complete Module Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive **Finance and Quantitative Engineering** curriculum designed to teach developers and engineers how to build production-ready financial systems from scratch. Unlike traditional finance courses or MBA programs, this curriculum focuses on **reverse-engineering and building real financial products** - from analyzing markets and building trading algorithms, to creating fintech platforms and deploying DeFi protocols.

**Core Philosophy**: Learn by reverse-engineering Bloomberg, Robinhood, Stripe, and Citadel - then build your own

**Target Audience**: Software engineers and developers who want to enter quantitative finance, fintech, or build financial products

**Prerequisites**:

- Python programming proficiency
- Basic statistics and probability
- Linear algebra fundamentals
- **No finance knowledge required** - we teach from zero

**Latest Update**: Completely restructured curriculum with improved module ordering, better onboarding, and more hands-on projects
